<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 106</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Praise ye Jehovah. </div><div class='q'>Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; </div><div class='q'>For his lovingkindness <span class='add'>endureth</span> forever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, </div><div class='q'>Or show forth all his praise? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Blessed are they that keep justice, </div><div class='q'>And he that doeth righteousness at all times. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; </div><div class='q'>Oh visit me with thy salvation, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, </div><div class='q'>That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, </div><div class='q'>That I may glory with thine inheritance. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We have sinned with our fathers, </div><div class='q'>We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; </div><div class='q'>They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, </div><div class='q'>But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, </div><div class='q'>That he might make his mighty power to be known. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: </div><div class='q'>So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, </div><div class='q'>And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the waters covered their adversaries; </div><div class='q'>There was not one of them left. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then believed they his words; </div><div class='q'>They sang his praise. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They soon forgat his works; </div><div class='q'>They waited not for his counsel, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, </div><div class='q'>And tempted God in the desert. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he gave them their request, </div><div class='q'>But sent leanness into their soul. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They envied Moses also in the camp, </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>And</span> Aaron the saint of Jehovah. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, </div><div class='q'>And covered the company of Abiram. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And a fire was kindled in their company; </div><div class='q'>The flame burned up the wicked. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They made a calf in Horeb, </div><div class='q'>And worshipped a molten image. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thus they changed their glory </div><div class='q'>For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They forgat God their Saviour, </div><div class='q'>Who had done great things in Egypt, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>And</span> terrible things by the Red Sea. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, </div><div class='q'>Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, </div><div class='q'>To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy <span class='add'>them</span>. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, </div><div class='q'>They believed not his word, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But murmured in their tents, </div><div class='q'>And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore he sware unto them, </div><div class='q'>That he would overthrow them in the wilderness, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, </div><div class='q'>And scatter them in the lands. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, </div><div class='q'>And ate the sacrifices of the dead. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; </div><div class='q'>And the plague brake in upon them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; </div><div class='q'>And so the plague was stayed. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, </div><div class='q'>Unto all generations for evermore. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, </div><div class='q'>So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Because they were rebellious against his spirit, </div><div class='q'>And he spake unadvisedly with his lips. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They did not destroy the peoples, </div><div class='q'>As Jehovah commanded them, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But mingled themselves with the nations, </div><div class='q'>And learned their works, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And served their idols, </div><div class='q'>Which became a snare unto them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And shed innocent blood, </div><div class='q'>Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, </div><div class='q'>Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; </div><div class='q'>And the land was polluted with blood. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Thus were they defiled with their works, </div><div class='q'>And played the harlot in their doings. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, </div><div class='q'>And he abhorred his inheritance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he gave them into the hand of the nations; </div><div class='q'>And they that hated them ruled over them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Their enemies also oppressed them, </div><div class='q'>And they were brought into subjection under their hand. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Many times did he deliver them; </div><div class='q'>But they were rebellious in their counsel, </div><div class='q'>And were brought low in their iniquity. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Nevertheless he regarded their distress, </div><div class='q'>When he heard their cry: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he remembered for them his covenant, </div><div class='q'>And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>He made them also to be pitied </div><div class='q'>Of all those that carried them captive. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Save us, O Jehovah our God, </div><div class='q'>And gather us from among the nations, </div><div class='q'>To give thanks unto thy holy name, </div><div class='q'>And to triumph in thy praise. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, </div><div class='q'>From everlasting even to everlasting. </div><div class='q'>And let all the people say, Amen. </div><div class='q'>Praise ye Jehovah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
