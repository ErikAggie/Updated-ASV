 <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>thou shalt not be afraid of them: thou shalt well remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so shall Jehovah thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moreover Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves, perish from before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Jehovah thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But Jehovah thy God will deliver them up before thee, and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he will deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, and become a devoted thing like unto it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing. </div><ul class='tnav'>
