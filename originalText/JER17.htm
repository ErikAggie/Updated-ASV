They that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Jehovah, the fountain of living waters.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of Jehovah? let it come now.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee; neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was before thy face.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Be not a terror unto me: thou art my refuge in the day of evil.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let them be put to shame that persecute me, but let not me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed; bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thus said Jehovah unto me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and say unto them, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work: but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith Jehovah, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill-country, and from the South, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meal-offerings, and frankincense, and bringing <span class='add'>sacrifices of</span> thanksgiving, unto the house of Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched. </div><ul class='tnav'>
