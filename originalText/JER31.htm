is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearneth for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith Jehovah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Set thee up waymarks, make thee guide-posts; set thy heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>How long wilt thou go hither and thither, O thou backsliding daughter? for Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity: Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; Jehovah of hosts is his name:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>If these ordinances depart from before me, saith Jehovah, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Thus saith Jehovah: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith Jehovah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the measuring line shall go out further straight onward unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
