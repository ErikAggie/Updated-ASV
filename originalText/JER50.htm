<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 50</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The word that Jehovah spake concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Jehovah their God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces thitherward, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Come ye, and join yourselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that prey upon her shall be satisfied, saith Jehovah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder my heritage, because ye are wanton as a heifer that treadeth out <span class='add'>the grain</span>, and neigh as strong horses;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Because of the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Shout against her round about: she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Jehovah hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work <span class='add'>to do </span> in the land of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Come against her from the utmost border; open her store-houses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath been proud against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all that took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>The king of Babylon hath heard the tidings of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, <span class='add'>and</span> pangs as of a woman in travail.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Behold, <span class='add'>the enemy</span> shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that can stand before me?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, <span class='add'>even</span> the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
