Moreover Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this <span class='add'>too</span> after the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wherefore thou art great, O Jehovah God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, whom thou redeemest to thee out of Egypt, <span class='add'>from</span> the nations and their gods?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And now, O Jehovah God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord Jehovah, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
