These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So Moses went down unto the people, and told them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
