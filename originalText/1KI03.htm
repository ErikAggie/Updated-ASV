And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice. </div><ul class='tnav'>
