<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 69</div><div class='d'>For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim. <span class='add'>A Psalm</span> of David. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Save me, O God; </div><div class='q'>For the waters are come in unto my soul. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: </div><div class='q'>I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: </div><div class='q'>Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: </div><div class='q'>They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: </div><div class='q'>That which I took not away I have to restore. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; </div><div class='q'>And my sins are not hid from thee. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: </div><div class='q'>Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; </div><div class='q'>Shame hath covered my face. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, </div><div class='q'>And an alien unto my mother’s children. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; </div><div class='q'>And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When I wept, <span class='add'>and chastened</span> my soul with fasting, </div><div class='q'>That was to my reproach. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When I made sackcloth my clothing, </div><div class='q'>I became a byword unto them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They that sit in the gate talk of me; </div><div class='q'>And <span class='add'>I am</span> the song of the drunkards. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time: </div><div class='q'>O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, </div><div class='q'>Answer me in the truth of thy salvation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: </div><div class='q'>Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, </div><div class='q'>Neither let the deep swallow me up; </div><div class='q'>And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy lovingkindness is good: </div><div class='q'>According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And hide not thy face from thy servant; </div><div class='q'>For I am in distress; answer me speedily. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: </div><div class='q'>Ransom me because of mine enemies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: </div><div class='q'>Mine adversaries are all before thee. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: </div><div class='q'>And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; </div><div class='q'>And for comforters, but I found none. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They gave me also gall for my food; </div><div class='q'>And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let their table before them become a snare; </div><div class='q'>And when they are in peace, <span class='add'>let it become</span> a trap. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; </div><div class='q'>And make their loins continually to shake. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Pour out thine indignation upon them, </div><div class='q'>And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Let their habitation be desolate; </div><div class='q'>Let none dwell in their tents. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; </div><div class='q'>And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Add iniquity unto their iniquity; </div><div class='q'>And let them not come into thy righteousness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Let them be blotted out of the book of life, </div><div class='q'>And not be written with the righteous. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But I am poor and sorrowful: </div><div class='q'>Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I will praise the name of God with a song, </div><div class='q'>And will magnify him with thanksgiving. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And it will please Jehovah better than an ox, </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>Or</span> a bullock that hath horns and hoofs. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The meek have seen it, and are glad: </div><div class='q'>Ye that seek after God, let your heart live. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For Jehovah heareth the needy, </div><div class='q'>And despiseth not his prisoners. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Let heaven and earth praise him, </div><div class='q'>The seas, and everything that moveth therein. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; </div><div class='q'>And they shall abide there, and have it in possession. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The seed also of his servants shall inherit it; </div><div class='q'>And they that love his name shall dwell therein. </div><ul class='tnav'>
