<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down <span class='add'>to sleep</span>, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>that Jehovah called Samuel: and he said, Here am I.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said, What is the thing that <span class='add'>Jehovah</span> hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
