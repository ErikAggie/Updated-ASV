Why? saith Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house that lieth waste, while ye run every man to his own house.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholdeth its fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him; and the people did fear before Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then spake Haggai Jehovah’s messenger in Jehovah’s message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work on the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>in the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth <span class='add'>month</span>, in the second year of Darius the king. </div><ul class='tnav'>
