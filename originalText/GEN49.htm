<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 49</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; </div><div class='q'>And hearken unto Israel your father. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength; </div><div class='q'>The pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence; </div><div class='q'>Because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; </div><div class='q'>Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Simeon and Levi are brethren; </div><div class='q'>Weapons of violence are their swords. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>O my soul, come not thou into their council; </div><div class='q'>Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united; </div><div class='q'>For in their anger they slew a man, </div><div class='q'>And in their self-will they hocked an ox. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; </div><div class='q'>And their wrath, for it was cruel: </div><div class='q'>I will divide them in Jacob, </div><div class='q'>And scatter them in Israel. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: </div><div class='q'>Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; </div><div class='q'>Thy father’s sons shall bow down before thee. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Judah is a lion’s whelp; </div><div class='q'>From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: </div><div class='q'>He stooped down, he couched as a lion, </div><div class='q'>And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, </div><div class='q'>Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, </div><div class='q'>Until Shiloh come; </div><div class='q'>And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Binding his foal unto the vine, </div><div class='q'>And his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; </div><div class='q'>He hath washed his garments in wine, </div><div class='q'>And his vesture in the blood of grapes: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His eyes shall be red with wine, </div><div class='q'>And his teeth white with milk. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; </div><div class='q'>And he shall be for a haven of ships; </div><div class='q'>And his border shall be upon Sidon. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Issachar is a strong ass, </div><div class='q'>Couching down between the sheepfolds: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he saw a resting-place that it was good, </div><div class='q'>And the land that it was pleasant; </div><div class='q'>And he bowed his shoulder to bear, </div><div class='q'>And became a servant under taskwork. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Dan shall judge his people, </div><div class='q'>As one of the tribes of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Dan shall be a serpent in the way, </div><div class='q'>An adder in the path, </div><div class='q'>That biteth the horse’s heels, </div><div class='q'>So that his rider falleth backward. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Gad, a troop shall press upon him; </div><div class='q'>But he shall press upon their heel. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, </div><div class='q'>And he shall yield royal dainties. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Naphtali is a hind let loose: </div><div class='q'>He giveth goodly words. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Joseph is a fruitful bough, </div><div class='q'>A fruitful bough by a fountain; </div><div class='q'>His branches run over the wall. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The archers have sorely grieved him, </div><div class='q'>And shot at him, and persecuted him: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But his bow abode in strength, </div><div class='q'>And the arms of his hands were made strong, </div><div class='q'>By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob </div><div class='q'>(From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel), </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, </div><div class='q'>And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, </div><div class='q'>With blessings of heaven above, </div><div class='q'>Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, </div><div class='q'>Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The blessings of thy father </div><div class='q'>Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors </div><div class='q'>Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: </div><div class='q'>They shall be on the head of Joseph, </div><div class='q'>And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth: </div><div class='q'>In the morning he shall devour the prey, </div><div class='q'>And at even he shall divide the spoil. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah—  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
