I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because that Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the elders of the Jews builded and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth <span class='add'>day</span> of the first month.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the children of Israel that were come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, did eat,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for Jehovah had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
