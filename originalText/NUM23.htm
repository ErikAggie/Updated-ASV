And he went to a bare height.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Jehovah put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he took up his parable, and said, </div><div class='q'>From Aram hath Balak brought me, </div><div class='q'>The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: </div><div class='q'>Come, curse me Jacob, </div><div class='q'>And come, defy Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? </div><div class='q'>And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For from the top of the rocks I see him, </div><div class='q'>And from the hills I behold him: </div><div class='q'>Lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, </div><div class='q'>And shall not be reckoned among the nations. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who can count the dust of Jacob, </div><div class='q'>Or number the fourth part of Israel? </div><div class='q'>Let me die the death of the righteous, </div><div class='q'>And let my last end be like his! </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me?

And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he took up his parable, and said, </div><div class='q'>Rise up, Balak, and hear; </div><div class='q'>Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>God is not a man, that he should lie, </div><div class='q'>Neither the son of man, that he should repent: </div><div class='q'>Hath he said, and will he not do it? </div><div class='q'>Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold, I have received <span class='add'>commandment</span> to bless: </div><div class='q'>And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; </div><div class='q'>Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: </div><div class='q'>Jehovah his God is with him, </div><div class='q'>And the shout of a king is among them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; </div><div class='q'>He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; </div><div class='q'>Neither is there any divination with Israel: </div><div class='q'>Now shalt it be said of Jacob and of Israel, </div><div class='q'>What hath God wrought! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, </div><div class='q'>And as a lion doth he lift himself up: </div><div class='q'>He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, </div><div class='q'>And drink the blood of the slain. </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. </div><ul class='tnav'>
