Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Every man is become brutish <span class='add'>and is</span> without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel <span class='add'>it</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is <span class='add'>my</span> grief, and I must bear it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name; for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
