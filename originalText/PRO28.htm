</div><div class='q'>But by men of understanding <span class='add'>and</span> knowledge the state <span class='add'>thereof </span> shall be prolonged. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A needy man that oppresseth the poor </div><div class='q'>Is <span class='add'>like</span> a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They that forsake the law praise the wicked; </div><div class='q'>But such as keep the law contend with them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Evil men understand not justice; </div><div class='q'>But they that seek Jehovah understand all things. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, </div><div class='q'>Than he that is perverse in <span class='add'>his</span> ways, though he be rich. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son; </div><div class='q'>But he that is a companion of gluttons shameth his father. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase, </div><div class='q'>Gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, </div><div class='q'>Even his prayer is an abomination. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, </div><div class='q'>He shall fall himself into his own pit; </div><div class='q'>But the perfect shall inherit good. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The rich man is wise in his own conceit; </div><div class='q'>But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; </div><div class='q'>But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper; </div><div class='q'>But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Happy is the man that feareth alway; </div><div class='q'>But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> a roaring lion, and a ranging bear, </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>So is</span> a wicked ruler over a poor people. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor; </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>But</span> he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>A man that is laden with the blood of any person </div><div class='q'>Shall flee unto the pit; let no man stay him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered; </div><div class='q'>But he that is perverse in <span class='add'>his</span> ways shall fall at once. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread; </div><div class='q'>But he that followeth after vain <span class='add'>persons</span> shall have poverty enough. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>A faithful man shall abound with blessings; </div><div class='q'>But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>To have respect of persons is not good; </div><div class='q'>Neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches, </div><div class='q'>And knoweth not that want shall come upon him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favor </div><div class='q'>Than he that flattereth with the tongue. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression, </div><div class='q'>The same is the companion of a destroyer. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife; </div><div class='q'>But he that putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be made fat. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; </div><div class='q'>But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; </div><div class='q'>But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; </div><div class='q'>But when they perish, the righteous increase. </div><ul class='tnav'>
