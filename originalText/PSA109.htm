<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 109</div><div class='d'>For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: </div><div class='q'>They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, </div><div class='q'>And fought against me without a cause. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For my love they are my adversaries: </div><div class='q'>But I <span class='add'>give myself unto</span> prayer. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they have rewarded me evil for good, </div><div class='q'>And hatred for my love. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Set thou a wicked man over him; </div><div class='q'>And let an adversary stand at his right hand. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; </div><div class='q'>And let his prayer be turned into sin. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let his days be few; </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>And</span> let another take his office. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let his children be fatherless, </div><div class='q'>And his wife a widow. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; </div><div class='q'>And let them seek <span class='add'>their bread</span> out of their desolate places. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; </div><div class='q'>And let strangers make spoil of his labor. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; </div><div class='q'>Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let his posterity be cut off; </div><div class='q'>In the generation following let their name be blotted out. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; </div><div class='q'>And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let them be before Jehovah continually, </div><div class='q'>That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Because he remembered not to show kindness, </div><div class='q'>But persecuted the poor and needy man, </div><div class='q'>And the broken in heart, to slay <span class='add'>them</span>. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; </div><div class='q'>And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, </div><div class='q'>And it came into his inward parts like water, </div><div class='q'>And like oil into his bones. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, </div><div class='q'>And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, </div><div class='q'>And of them that speak evil against my soul. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy name’s sake: </div><div class='q'>Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For I am poor and needy, </div><div class='q'>And my heart is wounded within me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: </div><div class='q'>I am tossed up and down as the locust. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>My knees are weak through fasting; </div><div class='q'>And my flesh faileth of fatness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I am become also a reproach unto them: </div><div class='q'>When they see me, they shake their head. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Help me, O Jehovah my God; </div><div class='q'>Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>That they may know that this is thy hand; </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>That</span> thou, Jehovah, hast done it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Let them curse, but bless thou: </div><div class='q'>When they arise, they shall be put to shame, </div><div class='q'>But thy servant shall rejoice. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, </div><div class='q'>And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; </div><div class='q'>Yea, I will praise him among the multitude. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, </div><div class='q'>To save him from them that judge his soul. </div><ul class='tnav'>
