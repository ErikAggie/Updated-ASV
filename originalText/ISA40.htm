And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, <span class='add'>and</span> will gently lead those that have their young. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Who hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah, or being his counsellor hath taught him?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The image, a workman hath cast <span class='add'>it</span>, and the goldsmith overlayeth it with gold, and casteth <span class='add'>for it</span> silver chains.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He that is too impoverished for <span class='add'>such</span> an oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a skilful workman to set up a graven image, that shall not be moved.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> he that sitteth above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>that bringeth princes to nothing; that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Yea, they have not been planted; yea, they have not been sown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth: moreover he bloweth upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal <span class='add'>to him</span>? saith the Holy One.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number; he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from Jehovah, and the justice <span class='add'>due</span> to me is passed away from my God?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard?
