Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>What can David <span class='add'>say</span> yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O Jehovah, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all <span class='add'>these</span> great things.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found <span class='add'>in his heart</span> to pray before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
