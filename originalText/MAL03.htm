Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Will a man rob God? yet ye rob me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Ye are cursed with the curse; for ye rob me, even this whole nation.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough <span class='add'>to receive it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And all nations shall call you happy; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Ye have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and escape. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then they that feared Jehovah spake one with another; and Jehovah hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they shall be mine, saith Jehovah of hosts, <span class='add'>even</span> mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not. </div><ul class='tnav'>
