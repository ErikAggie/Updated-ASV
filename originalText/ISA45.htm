I will gird thee, though thou hast not known me;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none besides me: I am Jehovah, and there is none else.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I am Jehovah, that doeth all these things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Distil, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, that it may bring forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up together; I, Jehovah, have created it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth!
