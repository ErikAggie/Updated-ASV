And Moses prayed for the people.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>From thence they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>From thence they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah, </div><div class='q'>Vaheb in Suphah, </div><div class='q'>And the valleys of the Arnon, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the slope of the valleys </div><div class='q'>That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar, </div><div class='q'>And leaneth upon the border of Moab. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And from thence <span class='add'>they journeyed</span> to Beer: that is the well whereof Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then sang Israel this song: </div><div class='q'>Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The well, which the princes digged, </div><div class='q'>Which the nobles of the people delved, </div><div class='q'>With the sceptre, <span class='add'>and</span> with their staves. </div><div class='m'>And from the wilderness <span class='add'>they journeyed</span> to Mattanah;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed thy border.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, </div><div class='q'>Come ye to Heshbon; </div><div class='q'>Let the city of Sihon be built and established: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, </div><div class='q'>A flame from the city of Sihon: </div><div class='q'>It hath devoured Ar of Moab, </div><div class='q'>The lords of the high places of the Arnon. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Woe to thee, Moab! </div><div class='q'>Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: </div><div class='q'>He hath given his sons as fugitives, </div><div class='q'>And his daughters into captivity, </div><div class='q'>Unto Sihon king of the Amorites. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, </div><div class='q'>And we have laid waste even unto Nophah, </div><div class='q'>Which <span class='add'>reacheth</span> unto Medeba. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Jehovah said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
