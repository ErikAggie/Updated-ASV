it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis <span class='add'>shall have</span> adversaries in the day-time.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword; and these <span class='add'>cities</span> shall go into captivity.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first <span class='add'>month</span>, in the seventh <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up, to apply <span class='add'>healing</span> medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong <span class='add'>arm</span>, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
