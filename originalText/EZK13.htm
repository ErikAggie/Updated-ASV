Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make <span class='add'>them</span> fly, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make <span class='add'>them</span> fly.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore ye shall no more see false visions, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
