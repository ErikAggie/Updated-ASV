And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me with good words, <span class='add'>even</span> comfortable words.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jehovah showed me four smiths.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
