And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not <span class='add'>thy word</span> against the house of Isaac;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
