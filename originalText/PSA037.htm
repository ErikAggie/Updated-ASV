</div><div class='q'>Dwell in the land, and feed on <span class='add'>his</span> faithfulness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Delight thyself also in Jehovah; </div><div class='q'>And he will give thee the desires of thy heart. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Commit thy way unto Jehovah; </div><div class='q'>Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, </div><div class='q'>And thy justice as the noonday. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: </div><div class='q'>Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, </div><div class='q'>Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: </div><div class='q'>Fret not thyself, <span class='add'>it tendeth</span> only to evil-doing. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For evil-doers shall be cut off; </div><div class='q'>But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: </div><div class='q'>Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the meek shall inherit the land, </div><div class='q'>And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The wicked plotteth against the just, </div><div class='q'>And gnasheth upon him with his teeth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The Lord will laugh at him; </div><div class='q'>For he seeth that his day is coming. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, </div><div class='q'>To cast down the poor and needy, </div><div class='q'>To slay such as are upright in the way. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, </div><div class='q'>And their bows shall be broken. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Better is a little that the righteous hath </div><div class='q'>Than the abundance of many wicked. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; </div><div class='q'>But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; </div><div class='q'>And their inheritance shall be for ever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil;

</div><div class='q'>None of his steps shall slide. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The wicked watcheth the righteous, </div><div class='q'>And seeketh to slay him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, </div><div class='q'>Nor condemn him when he is judged. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, </div><div class='q'>And he will exalt thee to inherit the land: </div><div class='q'>When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>I have seen the wicked in great power, </div><div class='q'>And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: </div><div class='q'>Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright;
