He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But the witness which I have is greater than <span class='add'>that of</span> John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me;  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>I receive not glory from men.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that <span class='add'>cometh</span> from the only God ye seek not?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, <span class='add'>even</span> Moses, on whom ye have set your hope.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? </div><ul class='tnav'>
