And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened <span class='add'>them</span>; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
