But thou saidst, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>who say to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Wherefore will ye contend with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? or a land of thick darkness? wherefore say my people, We are broken loose; we will come no more unto thee?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>How trimmest thou thy way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: thou didst not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Yet thou saidst, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>From thence also shalt thou go forth, with thy hands upon thy head: for Jehovah hath rejected those in whom thou trustest, and thou shalt not prosper with them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
