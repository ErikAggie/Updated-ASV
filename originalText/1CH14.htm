And Jehovah said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
