<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding <span class='add'>me</span> with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what <span class='add'>can</span> the man <span class='add'>do</span> that cometh after the king? <span class='add'>even </span> that which hath been done long ago.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For all his days are <span class='add'>but</span> sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>There is nothing better for a man <span class='add'>than</span> that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For to the man that pleaseth him <span class='add'>God</span> giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. </div><ul class='tnav'>
