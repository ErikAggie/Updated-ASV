These were the heads of the fathers’ <span class='add'>houses</span> of Ladan.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, for ever, to burn incense before Jehovah, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
