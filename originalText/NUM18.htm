and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This shall be thine of the most holy things, <span class='add'>reserved</span> from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovah’s heave-offering to Aaron the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not. </div><ul class='tnav'>
