But Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked Jehovah to wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Ye have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Jehovah had said he would destroy you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I prayed unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm. </div><ul class='tnav'>
