Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith Jehovah: yet I loved Jacob;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and <span class='add'>gave </span> his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle <span class='add'>fire on</span> mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name <span class='add'>shall be</span> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense <span class='add'>shall be</span> offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name <span class='add'>shall be</span> great among the Gentiles, saith Jehovah of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles. </div><ul class='tnav'>
