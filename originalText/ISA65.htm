<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 65</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I am inquired of by them that asked not <span class='add'>for me</span>; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>a people that provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>that sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; that eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>that say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants’ sake, that I may not destroy them all.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; and the Lord Jehovah will slay thee; and he will call his servants by another name:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
