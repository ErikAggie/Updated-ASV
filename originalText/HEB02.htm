But now we see not yet all things subjected to him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But we behold him who hath been made a little lower than the angels, <span class='add'>even</span> Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for every <span class='add'>man</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>saying, </div><div class='q'>I will declare thy name unto my brethren, </div><div class='q'>In the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For verily not to angels doth he give help, but he giveth help to the seed of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Wherefore it behooved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted. </div><ul class='tnav'>
