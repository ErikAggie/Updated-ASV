And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days. </div><ul class='tnav'>
