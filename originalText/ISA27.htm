I would march upon them, I would burn them together.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; <span class='add'>yea</span>, let him make peace with me.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In days to come shall Jacob take root; Israel shall blossom and bud; and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Hath he smitten them as he smote those that smote them? or are they slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by them?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>In measure, when thou sendest them away, thou dost contend with them; he hath removed <span class='add'>them</span> with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, <span class='add'>so that</span> the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come, and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have compassion upon them, and he that formed them will show them no favor. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will beat off <span class='add'>his fruit</span> from the flood of the River unto the brook of Egypt; and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great trumpet shall be blown; and they shall come that were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and they that were outcasts in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jerusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
