When thou hast ceased to destroy, thou shalt be destroyed; and when thou hast made an end of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>O Jehovah, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou our arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth: as locusts leap shall men leap upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Jehovah is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah is thy treasure. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: <span class='add'>the enemy </span> hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is confounded and withereth away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off <span class='add'>their leaves</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from taking a bribe, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given <span class='add'>him</span>; his waters shall be sure. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a land that reacheth afar.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thy heart shall muse on the terror: Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed <span class='add'>the tribute</span>? where is he that counted the towers?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But there Jehovah will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king; he will save us.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. </div><ul class='tnav'>
