 <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>then shall he that offereth his oblation offer unto Jehovah a meal-offering of a tenth part <span class='add'>of an ephah</span> of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts <span class='add'>of an ephah</span> of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and for the drink-offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace-offerings unto Jehovah;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>then shall he offer with the bullock a meal-offering of three tenth parts <span class='add'>of an ephah</span> of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and thou shalt offer for the drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>All that are home-born shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; as ye do, so he shall do.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth <span class='add'>with you</span>, a statute for ever throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering unto Jehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for a heave-offering: as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto Jehovah a heave-offering throughout your generations. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>even all that Jehovah hath commanded you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah, with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin-offering.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin-offering before Jehovah, for their error:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;

and he shall be forgiven.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is home-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemeth Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Because he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Jehovah said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him to death with stones;
