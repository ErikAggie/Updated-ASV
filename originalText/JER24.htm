And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus saith Jehovah, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers. </div><ul class='tnav'>
