<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 33</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he said, </div><div class='q'>Jehovah came from Sinai, </div><div class='q'>And rose from Seir unto them; </div><div class='q'>He shined forth from mount Paran, </div><div class='q'>And he came from the ten thousands of holy ones: </div><div class='q'>At his right hand was a fiery law for them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Yea, he loveth the people; </div><div class='q'>All his saints are in thy hand: </div><div class='q'>And they sat down at thy feet; </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>Every one</span> shall receive of thy words. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Moses commanded us a law, </div><div class='q'>An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he was king in Jeshurun, </div><div class='q'>When the heads of the people were gathered, </div><div class='q'>All the tribes of Israel together. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let Reuben live, and not die; </div><div class='q'>Nor let his men be few. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And this is <span class='add'>the blessing</span> of Judah: and he said, </div><div class='q'>Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, </div><div class='q'>And bring him in unto his people. </div><div class='q'>With his hands he contended for himself; </div><div class='q'>And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And of Levi he said, </div><div class='q'>Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy godly one, </div><div class='q'>Whom thou didst prove at Massah, </div><div class='q'>With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him; </div><div class='q'>Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, </div><div class='q'>Nor knew he his own children: </div><div class='q'>For they have observed thy word, </div><div class='q'>And keep thy covenant. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, </div><div class='q'>And Israel thy law: </div><div class='q'>They shall put incense before thee, </div><div class='q'>And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Bless, Jehovah, his substance, </div><div class='q'>And accept the work of his hands: </div><div class='q'>Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him, </div><div class='q'>And of them that hate him, that they rise not again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Of Benjamin he said, </div><div class='q'>The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him; </div><div class='q'>He covereth him all the day long, </div><div class='q'>And he dwelleth between his shoulders. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And of Joseph he said, </div><div class='q'>Blessed of Jehovah be his land, </div><div class='q'>For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, </div><div class='q'>And for the deep that coucheth beneath, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, </div><div class='q'>And for the precious things of the growth of the moons, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, </div><div class='q'>And for the precious things of the everlasting hills, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, </div><div class='q'>And the good will of him that dwelt in the bush. </div><div class='q'>Let <span class='add'>the blessing</span> come upon the head of Joseph, </div><div class='q'>And upon the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The firstling of his herd, majesty is his;
