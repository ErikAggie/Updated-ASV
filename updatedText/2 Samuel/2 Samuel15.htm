And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices.
