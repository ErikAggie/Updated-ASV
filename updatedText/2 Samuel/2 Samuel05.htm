Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand?
