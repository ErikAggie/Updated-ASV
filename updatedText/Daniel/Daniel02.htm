So they came in and stood before the king. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king’s matter, forasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding; <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the king’s matter. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king; <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came <span class="add">into thy mind</span> upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Thou, O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image.
