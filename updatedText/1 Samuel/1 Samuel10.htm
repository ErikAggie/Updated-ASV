Is Saul also among the prophets? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Samuel called the people together unto Jehovah to Mizpah; <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you: <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, <span class="add">Nay</span>, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, <span class="add">Long</span> live the king.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.</div></body></html>
