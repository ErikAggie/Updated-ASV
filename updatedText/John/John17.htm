Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we <span class="add">are</span>. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil <span class="add">one</span>. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, <span class="add">art</span> in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we <span class="add">are</span> one; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.</div></body></html>
