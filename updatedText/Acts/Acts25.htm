I appeal unto Cæsar. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Cæsar: unto Cæsar shalt thou go.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Cæsarea, and saluted Festus. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And as they tarried there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed <span class="add">me</span>, asking for sentence against him. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defence concerning the matter laid against him. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Cæsar. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Agrippa <span class="add">said</span> unto Festus, I also could wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and the principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him.</div></body></html>
