Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I say unto you, that unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But these mine enemies, that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>saying, Go your way into the village over against <span class="add">you</span>; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said unto them. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And they said, The Lord hath need of him. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And as he went, they spread their garments in the way. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And as he was now drawing nigh, <span class="add">even</span> at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen; <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>saying, Blessed <span class="add">is</span> the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it, <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>saying, If thou hadst known in this day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold, <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And he was teaching daily in the temple.
