David spake to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>and he said,</div><div class="q" >Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>God, my rock, in him will I take refuge;</div><div class="q" >My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge;</div><div class="q" >My saviour, you savest me from violence.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised:</div><div class="q" >So will I be saved from mine enemies.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For the waves of death compassed me;</div><div class="q" >The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>The cords of Sheol were round about me;</div><div class="q" >The snares of death came upon me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>In my distress I called upon Jehovah;</div><div class="q" >Yea, I called to my God:</div><div class="q" >And he heard my voice out of his temple,</div><div class="q" >And my cry <span class="add">came</span> into his ears.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then the earth shook and trembled,</div><div class="q" >The foundations of heaven quaked</div><div class="q" >And were shaken, because he was wroth.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,</div><div class="q" >And fire out of his mouth devoured:</div><div class="q" >Coals were kindled by it.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down;</div><div class="q" >And thick darkness was under his feet.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly;</div><div class="q" >Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he made darkness pavilions round about him,</div><div class="q" >Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>At the brightness before him</div><div class="q" >Coals of fire were kindled.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Jehovah thundered from heaven,</div><div class="q" >And the Most High uttered his voice.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them;</div><div class="q" >Lightning, and discomfited them.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then the channels of the sea appeared,</div><div class="q" >The foundations of the world were laid bare,</div><div class="q" >By the rebuke of Jehovah,</div><div class="q" >At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He sent from on high, he took me;</div><div class="q" >He drew me out of many waters;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>He delivered me from my strong enemy,</div><div class="q" >From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>They came upon me in the day of my calamity;</div><div class="q" >But Jehovah was my stay.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>He brought me forth also into a large place;</div><div class="q" >He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness;</div><div class="q" >According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,</div><div class="q" >And have not wickedly departed from my God.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For all his ordinances were before me;</div><div class="q" >And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>I was also perfect toward him;</div><div class="q" >And I kept myself from mine iniquity.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness,</div><div class="q" >According to my cleanness in his eyesight.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>With the merciful you will show yourself merciful;</div><div class="q" >With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>With the pure you will show yourself pure;</div><div class="q" >And with the perverse you will show yourself froward.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And the afflicted people you will save;</div><div class="q" >But your eyes are upon the haughty, that you mayest bring them down.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For you are my lamp, O Jehovah;</div><div class="q" >And Jehovah will lighten my darkness.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For by you I run upon a troop;</div><div class="q" >By my God do I leap over a wall.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>As for God, his way is perfect:</div><div class="q" >The word of Jehovah is tried;</div><div class="q" >He is a

id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>He teacheth my hands to war,</div><div class="q" >So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>You hast also given me the shield of your salvation;</div><div class="q" >And your gentleness hath made me great.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>You hast enlarged my steps under me;</div><div class="q" >And my feet have not slipped.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them;</div><div class="q" >Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise:</div><div class="q" >Yea, they are fallen under my feet.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>For you hast girded me with strength to the battle;</div><div class="q" >You hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>You hast also made mine enemies turn their backs to me,</div><div class="q" >That I might cut off them that hate me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>They looked, but there was none to save;</div><div class="q" >Even to Jehovah, but he answered them not.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth,</div><div class="q" >I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>You also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people;</div><div class="q" >You hast kept me to be the head of the nations:</div><div class="q" >A people whom I have not known will serve me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>The foreigners will submit themselves to me:</div><div class="q" >As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>The foreigners will fade away,</div><div class="q" >And will come trembling out of their close places.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock;</div><div class="q" >And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,</div><div class="q" >And that bringeth down peoples under me,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies:</div><div class="q" >Yea, you liftest me up above them that rise up against me;</div><div class="q"
