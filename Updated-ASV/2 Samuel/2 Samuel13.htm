And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and feign yourself sick: and when your father cometh to see you, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray you, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray you, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and dress him food. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And when she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not you this folly. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And I, whither will I carry my shame? and as for you, you wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Howbeit he would not hearken to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And she said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is <span class="add">worse</span> than the other that you didst to me. But he would not hearken to her. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Absalom her brother said to her, Hath Amnon your brother been with you? but now hold your peace, my sister: he is your brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Absalom spake to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, your servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray you, and his servants go with your servant. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray you, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I say to you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king’s sons are come: as your servant said, so it is. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And <span class="add">David</span> mourned for his son every day. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And <span class="add">the soul of</span> king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
