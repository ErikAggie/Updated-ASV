And Ziba said, The asses are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the king said, And where is your master’s son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, you man of blood, and base fellow: <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Jehovah hath returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead you hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and, behold, you art <span class="add">taken</span> in thine own mischief, because you art a man of blood.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said to him, Curse David; who then will say, Wherefore hast you done so? <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more <span class="add">may</span> this Benjamite now <span class="add">do it</span>? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done to me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for <span class="add">his</span> cursing of me this day. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, <span class="add">Long</span> live the king, <span class="add">Long</span> live the king. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? why wentest you not with your friend? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Hushai said to Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And again, whom should I serve? <span class="add">should I</span> not <span class="add">serve </span> in the presence of his son? as I have served in your father’s presence, so will I be in your presence.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we will do. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father’s concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you art abhorred of your father: then will the hands of all that are with you be strong. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
