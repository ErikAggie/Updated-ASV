And he said, Your servant is he. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him? And Ziba said to the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold, your servant! <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And David said to him, Fear not; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore you all the land of Saul your father; and you shall eat bread at my table continually. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he did obeisance, and said, What is your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I am?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master’s son. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And you shall till the land for him, you, and your sons, and your servants; and you shall bring in <span class="add">the fruits</span>, that your master’s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth your master’s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall your servant do. As for Mephibosheth, <span class="add">said the king</span>, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king’s table.
