And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it was so, as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion <span class="add">of flesh</span>, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And David said to Michal, <span class="add">It was</span> before Jehovah, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: therefore will I play before Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken, of them shall I be had in honor. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
