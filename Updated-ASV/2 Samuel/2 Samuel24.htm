And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon, <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said to Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, O Jehovah, put away, I beseech you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying, <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Go and speak to David, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do it to you. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? or wilt you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? or will there be three days’ pestilence in your land? now advise you, and consider what answer I will return to him that sent me. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay your hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And David spake to Jehovah when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray you, be against me, and against my father’s house.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Jehovah commanded. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of you, to build an altar to Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from the people. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good to him: behold, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood: <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>all this, O king, doth Araunah give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, Jehovah your God accept you. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And the king said to Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of you at a price. Neither will I offer burnt-offerings to Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
