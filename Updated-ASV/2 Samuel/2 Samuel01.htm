And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray you, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And David said to the young man that told him, How knowest you that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here am I. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Who art you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to my lord.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And David said to the young man that told him, Whence art you? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And David said to him, How wast you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Jehovah’s anointed? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And David said to him, Your blood be upon your head; for your mouth hath testified against you, saying, I have slain Jehovah’s anointed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>(and he bade them teach the children of Judah <span class="add">the song of </span> the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Your glory, O Israel, is slain upon your high places!</div><div class="q" >How are the mighty fallen!</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Tell it not in Gath,</div><div class="q" >Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon;</div><div class="q" >Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,</div><div class="q" >Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>You mountains of Gilboa,</div><div class="q" >Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings:</div><div class="q" >For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,</div><div class="q" >The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,</div><div class="q" >The bow of Jonathan turned not back,</div><div class="q" >And the sword of Saul returned not empty.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,</div><div class="q" >And in their death they were not divided:</div><div class="q" >They were swifter than eagles,</div><div class="q" >They were stronger than lions.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,</div><div class="q" >Who clothed you in scarlet delicately,</div><div class="q" >Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!</div><div class="q" >Jonathan is slain upon your high places.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan:</div><div class="q" >Very pleasant hast you been to me:</div><div class="q" >Your love to me was wonderful,</div><div class="q" >Passing the love of women.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>How are the mighty fallen,</div><div class="q" >And the weapons of war perished!</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
