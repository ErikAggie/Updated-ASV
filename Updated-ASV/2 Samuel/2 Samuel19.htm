For you hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought to you: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to your servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if you go not forth, there will not tarry a man with you this night: and that will be worse to you than all the evil that hath befallen you from your youth until now. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king.</div><div class="p" >Now Israel had fled every man to his tent. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak you not a word of bringing the king back?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, <span class="add">to bring him</span> to his house. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>You are my brethren, you are my bone and my flesh: wherefore then are you the last to bring back the king? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And say you to Amasa, Art you not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as <span class="add">the heart of</span> one man; so that they sent to the king, <span class="add">saying</span>, Return you, and all your servants. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For your servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah’s anointed? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries to me? will there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel? <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the king said to Shimei, You shall not die. And the king sware to him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Wherefore wentest not you with me, Mephibosheth? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And he hath slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in your eyes. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet didst you set your servant among them that did eat at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And the king said to him, Why speakest you any more of your matters? I say, You and Ziba divide the land. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And Mephibosheth said to the king, yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace to his own house.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the king said to Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king? <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what will seem good to you. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And the king answered, Chimham will go over with me, and I will do to him that which will seem good to you: and whatsoever you shall require of me, that will I do for you. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him? <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift? <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more <span class="add">right</span> in David than you: why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
