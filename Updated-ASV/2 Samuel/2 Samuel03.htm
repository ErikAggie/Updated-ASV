These were born to David in Hebron.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and <span class="add">Ish-bosheth</span> said to Abner, Wherefore hast you gone in to my father’s concubine? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying <span class="add">also</span>, Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand will be with you, to bring about all Israel to you. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he said, Well; I will make a league with you; but one thing I require of you: that is, you shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you comest to see my face. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return: and he returned.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past you sought for David to be king over you: <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you mayest reign over all that your soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast you done? behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>You knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you doest. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the king lamented for Abner, and said,</div><div class="q" >Should Abner die as a fool dieth?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Thy hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters:</div><div class="q" >As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst you fall.</div><div class="m" >And all the people wept again over him. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun be down. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And the king said to his servants, Know you not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
