And he leaped up and walked. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the priest of Jupiter whose <span class="add">temple</span> was before the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>and saying, Sirs, why do you these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And yet he left not himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice to them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But there came Jews there from Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch, <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And when they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and there they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And they tarried no little time with the disciples.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
