and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>They therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the multitudes gave heed with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For <span class="add">from</span> many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And there was much joy in that city.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John: <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit: <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But Peter said to him, Your silver perish with you, because you hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>You hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is not right before God. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of your heart will be forgiven you. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Simon answered and said, Pray you for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken come upon me.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But an angel of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza: the same is desert. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship; <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join yourself to this chariot. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest you what you readest? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he said, How can I, except some one will guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this,</div><div class="q" >He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;</div><div class="q" >And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb,</div><div class="q" >So he openeth not his mouth:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away:</div><div class="q" >His generation who will declare?</div><div class="q" >For his life is taken from the earth.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray you, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other? <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached to him Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And as they went on the way, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, <span class="add">here is</span> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span> <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Some ancient authorities add, in whole or in part, v. 37. And Philip said, If you believest with all your heart, you mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. </span></a> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
