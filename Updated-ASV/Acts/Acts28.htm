who received us, and entertained us three days courteously. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And from there we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli; <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And from there the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said to them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans: <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal to Cæsar; not that I had anything whereof to accuse my nation. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with <span class="add">me</span>: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of you. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But we desire to hear of you what you thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded <span class="add">the matter,</span> testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers, <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>saying,</div><div class="q" >Go you to this people, and say,</div><div class="q" >By hearing you will hear, and will in no wise understand;</div><div class="q" >And seeing you will see, and will in no wise perceive:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For this people’s heart is waxed gross,</div><div class="q" >And their ears are dull of hearing,</div><div class="q" >And their eyes they have closed;</div><div class="q" >Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes,</div><div class="q" >And hear with their ears,</div><div class="q" >And understand with their heart,</div><div class="q" >And should turn again,</div><div class="q" >And I should heal them.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Be it known therefore to you, that this salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles: they will also hear. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Some ancient authorities insert v. 29: And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.</span></a></div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in to him, <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
