And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms are gone up for a memorial before God. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when the angel that spoke to him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>and having rehearsed all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Now on the morrow, as they were on their journey, and drew nigh to the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance; <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>and he beholdeth the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And a voice <span class="add">came</span> to him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, make not you common. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And this was done thrice: and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon’s house, stood before the gate, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodging there. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But arise, and get you down, and go with them, nothing doubting: for I have sent them. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek: what is the cause wherefore you are come? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man and one that feareth God, and well reported of by all the nation of the Jews, was warned <span class="add">of God</span> by a holy angel to send for you into his house, and to hear words from you. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>So he called them in and lodged them.</div><div class="p" >And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And on the morrow they entered into Cæsarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and his near friends. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when it came to pass that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And as he talked with him, he went in, and findeth many come together: <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>and he said to them, You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation; and <span class="add">yet</span> to me hath God showed that I should not call any man common or unclean: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>wherefore also I came without gainsaying, when I was sent for. I ask therefore with what intent you sent for me. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And Cornelius said, Four days ago, until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel, <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>and saith, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Send therefore to Joppa, and call to you Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Forthwith therefore I sent to you; and you have well done that you are come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded you of the Lord. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Peter opened his mouth, and said,</div><div class="p" >Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>The word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)— <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>that saying you yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">even</span> Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew, hanging him on a tree. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest, <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>not to all the people, but to witnesses that were chosen before of God, <span class="add">even</span> to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And he charged us to preach to the people, and to testify that this is he who is ordained of God <span class="add">to be</span> the Judge of the living and the dead. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one that believeth on him will receive remission of sins.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we? <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
