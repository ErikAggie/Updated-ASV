But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more accurately. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he came, he helped them much that had believed through grace; <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>for he powerfully confuted the Jews, <span class="add">and that</span> publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
