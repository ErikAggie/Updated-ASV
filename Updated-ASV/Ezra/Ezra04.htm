and we sacrifice to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ <span class="add">houses</span> of Israel, said to them, You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia;

for which cause was this city laid waste. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means you shall have no portion beyond the River.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">Then</span> sent the king an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and in the rest <span class="add">of the country</span> beyond the River: Peace, and so forth. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The letter which you sent to us hath been plainly read before me. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all <span class="add">the country</span> beyond the River;
