Amen.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But <span class="add">it is</span> not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac will your seed be called. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah will have a son. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, <span class="add">even </span> by our father Isaac— <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>for <span class="add">the children</span> being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth, <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>it was said to her, The elder will serve the younger. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>What will we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For the scripture saith to Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise you up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>You wilt say then to me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Nay but, O man, who art you that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst you make me thus? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel to honor, and another to dishonor? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared to glory, <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">even</span> us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>As he saith also in Hosea,</div><div class="q" >I will call that my people, which was not my people;</div><div class="q" >And her beloved, that was not beloved.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And it will be, <span class="add">that</span> in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people,</div><div class="q" >There will they be called sons of the living God.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that will be saved: <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>for the Lord will execute <span class="add">his</span> word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And, as Isaiah hath said before,</div><div class="q" >Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed,</div><div class="q" >We had become as Sodom, and had been made like to Gomorrah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>What will we say then?
