Yea, he will be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day <span class="add">alike</span>. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For whether we live, we live to the Lord; or whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For to this end Christ died and lived <span class="add">again</span>, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But you, why dost you judge your brother? or you again, why dost you set at nought your brother? for we will all stand before the judgment-seat of God. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For it is written,</div><div class="q" >As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee will bow,</div><div class="q" >And every tongue will confess to God.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>So then each one of us will give account of himself to God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge you this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For if because of meat your brother is grieved, you walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with your meat him for whom Christ died. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Let not then your good be evil spoken of: <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor <span class="add">to do anything </span> whereby your brother stumbleth. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The faith which you hast, have you to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because <span class="add">he eateth </span> not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
