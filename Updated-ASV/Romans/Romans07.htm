Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, You shall not covet: <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin <span class="add">is</span> dead. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>and the commandment, which <span class="add">was</span> to life, this I found <span class="add">to be</span> to death: <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Did then that which is good become death to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good;â€”that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But if what I would not, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good <span class="add">is</span> not. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Wretched man that I am! who will deliver me out of the body of this death? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
