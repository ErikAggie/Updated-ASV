(that is, to bring Christ down:) <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.) <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach: <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus <span class="add">as</span> Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same <span class="add">Lord</span> is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him: <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>So belief <span class="add">cometh</span> of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily,</div><div class="q" >Their sound went out into all the earth,</div><div class="q" >And their words unto the ends of the world.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith,</div><div class="q" >I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation,</div><div class="q" >With a nation void of understanding will I anger you.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah is very bold, and saith,</div><div class="q" >I was found of them that sought me not;</div><div class="q" >I became manifest unto them that asked not of me.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
