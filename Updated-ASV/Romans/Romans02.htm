<span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Or despisest you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth you to repentance? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>but after your hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>who will render to every man according to his works: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life: <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>but to them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, <span class="add">will be</span> wrath and indignation, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek: <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>for there is no respect of persons with God. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law; <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law will be justified; <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>(for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law to themselves; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing <span class="add">them</span>); <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But if you bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and art confident that you thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>you therefore that teachest another, teachest you not thyself?

<span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and will not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
