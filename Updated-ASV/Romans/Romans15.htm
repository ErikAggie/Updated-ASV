but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you fell upon me. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Wherefore receive you one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises <span class="add">given</span> to the fathers, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written,</div><div class="q" >Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles,</div><div class="q" >And sing to your name.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And again he saith,</div><div class="q" >Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And again,</div><div class="q" >Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles;</div><div class="q" >And let all the peoples praise him.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And again, Isaiah saith,</div><div class="q" >There will be the root of Jesse,</div><div class="q" >And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles;</div><div class="q" >On him will the Gentiles hope.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But I write the more boldly to you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was <span class="add">already</span> named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>but, as it is written,</div><div class="q" >They will see, to whom no tidings of him came,</div><div class="q" >And they who have not heard will understand.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you: <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you, <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>whensoever I go to Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I will have been satisfied with your company)— <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>but now, <span class="add">I say</span>, I go to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it <span class="add">to them</span> also to minister to them in carnal things. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you to Spain. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And I know that, when I come to you, I will come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judea, and <span class="add">that</span> my ministration which <span class="add">I have</span> for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints; <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Now the God of peace be with you all.
