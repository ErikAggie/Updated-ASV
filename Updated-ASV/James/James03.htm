If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Now if we put the horsesâ€™ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire! <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind: <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>but the tongue can no man tame; <span class="add">it is</span> a restless evil, <span class="add">it is</span> full of deadly poison. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet <span class="add">water </span> and bitter? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither <span class="add">can</span> salt water yield sweet.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>This wisdom is not <span class="add">a wisdom</span> that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
