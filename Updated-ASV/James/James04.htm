Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Or think you that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long to envying? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore <span class="add">the scripture</span> saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Be subject therefore to God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you doubleminded. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if you judgest the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>One <span class="add">only</span> is the lawgiver and judge, <span class="add">even</span> he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art you that judgest your neighbor?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Come now, you that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a youar there, and trade, and get gain: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>whereas you know not what will be on the morrow. What is your life? For you are a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For that you ought to say, If the Lord will, we will both live, and do this or that. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But now you glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
