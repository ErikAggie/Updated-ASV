<span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Wherefore even the first <span class="add">covenant</span> hath not been dedicated without blood. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us: <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And inasmuch as it is appointed to men once to die, and after this <span class="add">cometh</span> judgment; <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, to salvation.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
