<span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But if you are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are you bastards, and not sons. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: will we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For they indeed for a few days chastened <span class="add">us</span> as seemed good to them; but he for <span class="add">our</span> profit, that <span class="add">we</span> may be partakers of his holiness. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit to them that have been exercised thereby, <span class="add">even the fruit</span> of righteousness. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees; <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord: <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>looking carefully lest <span class="add">there be</span> any man that falleth short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble <span class="add">you</span>, and thereby the many be defiled; <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>lest <span class="add">there be</span> any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind <span class="add">in his father,</span> though he sought it diligently with tears.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For you are not come to <span class="add">a mount</span> that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which <span class="add">voice </span> they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken to them; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it will be stoned; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and so fearful was the appearance, <span class="add">that</span> Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>but you are come to mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels, <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than <span class="add">that of</span> Abel. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>See that you refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned <span class="add">them</span> on earth, much more <span class="add">will not</span> we <span class="add">escape</span> who turn away from him that <span class="add">warneth </span> from heaven: <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And this <span class="add">word</span>, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>for our God is a consuming fire.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
