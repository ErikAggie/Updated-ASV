So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that will arise out of the earth. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other <span class="add">horn</span> which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Thus he said, The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which will be diverse from all the kingdoms, and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down, and break it in pieces. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom will ten kings arise: and another will arise after them; and he will be diverse from the former, and he will put down three kings. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And he will speak words against the Most High, and will wear out the saints of the Most High; and he will think to change the times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But the judgment will be set, and they will take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey him. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
