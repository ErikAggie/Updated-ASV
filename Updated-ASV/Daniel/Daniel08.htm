<span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings <span class="add">and</span> mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And I heard a man’s voice between <span class="add">the banks of</span> the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The ram which you sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do <span class="add">his pleasure</span>; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in <span class="add">their</span> security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut you up the vision; for it belongeth to many days <span class="add">to come</span>. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
