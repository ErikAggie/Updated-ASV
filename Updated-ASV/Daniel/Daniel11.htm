Behold, there will stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth will be far richer than they all: and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he will stir up all against the realm of Greece. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And a mighty king will stand up, that will rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And when he will stand up, his kingdom will be broken, and will be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with what he ruled; for his kingdom will be plucked up, even for others besides these.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the king of the south will be strong, and <span class="add">one</span> of his princes; and he will be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion will be a great dominion. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And at the end of years they will join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she will not retain the strength of her arm; neither will he stand, nor his arm; but she will be given up, and they that brought her, and he that fathered her, and he that strengthened her in those times.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But out of a shoot from her roots will one stand up in his place, who will come to the army, and will enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and will deal against them, and will prevail. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And also their gods, with their molten images, <span class="add">and</span> with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, will he carry captive into Egypt; and he will refrain some years from the king of the north. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he will come into the realm of the king of the south, but he will return into his own land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And his sons will war, and will assemble a multitude of great forces, which will come on, and overflow, and pass through; and they will return and war, even to his fortress. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the king of the south will be moved with anger, and will come and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he will set forth a great multitude, and the multitude will be given into his hand. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the multitude will be lifted up, and his heart will be exalted; and he will cast down tens of thousands, but he will not prevail. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the king of the north will return, and will set forth a multitude greater than the former; and he will come on at the end of the times, <span class="add">even of</span> years, with a great army and with much substance. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And in those times there will many stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among your people will lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they will fall. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So the king of the north will come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city: and the forces of the south will not stand, neither his chosen people, neither will there be any strength to stand. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But he that comes against him will do according to his own will, and none will stand before him; and he will stand in the glorious land, and in his hand will be destruction. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he will set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions; and he will perform them: and he will give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she will not stand, neither be for him. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>After this will he turn his face to the isles, and will take many: but a prince will cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, moreover, he will cause his reproach to turn upon him. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he will stumble and fall, and will not be found.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then will stand up in his place one that will cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he will be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And in his place will stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom: but he will come in time of security, and will obtain the kingdom by flatteries. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the overwhelming forces will be overwhelmed from before him, and will be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And after the league made with him he will work deceitfully; for he will come up, and will become strong, with a small people. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>In time of security will he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he will do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathersâ€™ fathers; he will scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he will devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he will not stand; for they will devise devices against him. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Yea, they that eat of his dainties will destroy him, and his army will overflow; and many will fall down slain. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And as for both these kings, their hearts will be to do mischief, and they will speak lies at one table: but it will not prosper; for yet the end will be at the time appointed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Then will he return into his land with great substance; and his heart <span class="add">will be</span> against the holy covenant; and he will do <span class="add">his pleasure</span>, and return to his own land. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>At the time appointed he will return, and come into the south; but it will not be in the latter time as it was in the former. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be grieved, and will return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and will do <span class="add">his pleasure</span>: he will even return, and have regard to them that forsake the holy covenant. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And forces will stand on his part, and they will profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and will take away the continual <span class="add">burnt-offering</span>, and they will set up the abomination that maketh desolate. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And such as do wickedly against the covenant will he pervert by flatteries; but the people that know their God will be strong, and do <span class="add">exploits</span>. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And they that are wise among the people will instruct many; yet they will fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, <span class="add">many </span> days. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Now when they will fall, they will be helped with a little help; but many will join themselves to them with flatteries. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And some of them that are wise will fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And the king will do according to his will; and he will exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and will speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined will be done. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Neither will he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he will magnify himself above all. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>But in his place will he honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not will he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones and pleasant things. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And he will deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god: whosoever acknowledgeth <span class="add">him</span> he will increase with glory; and he will cause them to rule over many, and will divide the land for a price.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And at the time of the end will the king of the south contend with him; and the king of the north will come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter into the countries, and will overflow and pass through. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>He will enter also into the glorious land, and many <span class="add">countries </span> will be overthrown; but these will be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>He will stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt will not escape. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>But he will have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>But tidings out of the east and out of the north will trouble him; and he will go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>And he will plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he will come to his end, and none will help him.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
