And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that you didst set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard: and I am come for your wordsâ€™ sake. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Now I am come to make you understand what will befall your people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for <span class="add">many</span> days. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And when he had spoken to me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be to you, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake to me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for you hast strengthened me. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then said he, Knowest you wherefore I am come to you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece will come. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But I will tell you that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
