<span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>neither have we hearkened to your servants the prophets, that spake in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>O Lord, righteousness belongeth to you, but to us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither you hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>neither have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Yea, all Israel have transgressed your law, even turning aside, that they should not obey your voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in your truth. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore hath Jehovah watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth, and we have not obeyed his voice. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten you renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>O Lord, according to all your righteousness, let thine anger and your wrath, I pray you, be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people are become a reproach to all that are round about us. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O our God, hearken to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplications, and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousnesses, but for your great mercies’ sake. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come to give you wisdom and understanding. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>At the beginning of your supplications the commandment went forth, and I am come to tell you; for you are greatly beloved: therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Seventy weeks are decreed upon your people and upon your holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the anointed one, the prince, will be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: it will be built again, with street and moat, even in troublous times. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And after the threescore and two weeks will the anointed one be cut off, and will have nothing: and the people of the prince that will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof will be with a flood, and even to the end will be war; desolations are determined. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And he will make a firm covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; and upon the wing of abominations <span class="add">will come</span> one that maketh desolate; and even to the full end, and that determined, will <span class="add">wrath</span> be poured out upon the desolate.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
