And she said to her, Go, my daughter. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they answered him, Jehovah bless you. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then said Boaz to his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then said Boaz to Ruth, Hearest you not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Let your eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go you after them: have I not charged the young men that they will not touch you? and when you are athirst, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight, that you shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner? <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Boaz answered and said to her, It hath fully been showed me, all that you hast done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you hast left your father and your mother, and the land of your nativity, and art come to a people that you knewest not heretofore. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Jehovah recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to take refuge. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, for that you hast comforted me, and for that you hast spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I be not as one of your handmaidens.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And at meal-time Boaz said to her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And her mother-in-law said to her, Where hast you gleaned to-day? and where hast you wrought? blessed be he that did take knowledge of you. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is nigh of kin to us, one of our near kinsmen. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said to me, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they meet you not in any other field. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
