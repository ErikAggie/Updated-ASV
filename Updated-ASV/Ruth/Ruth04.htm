And he turned aside, and sat down. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here. And they sat down. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And he said to the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s: <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>and I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then said Boaz, What day you buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: take you my right of redemption on you; for I cannot redeem it.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now this was <span class="add">the custom</span> in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the <span class="add">manner of</span> attestation in Israel. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. And he drew off his shoe. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that is come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bare to Judah, of the seed which Jehovah will give you of this young woman.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Jehovah gave her conception, and she bare a son. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he will be to you a restorer of life, and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loveth you, who is better to you than seven sons, hath borne him. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and Hezron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadab, <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon, <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Obed, <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>and Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
