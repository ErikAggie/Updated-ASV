Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your raiment upon you, and get you down to the threshing-floor, but make not yourself known to the man, until he will have done eating and drinking. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And it will be, when he lieth down, that you shall mark the place where he will lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And she said to her, All that you sayest I will do.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he said, Who art you? And she answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you art a near kinsman. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he said, Blessed be you of Jehovah, my daughter: you hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you followedst not young men, whether poor or rich. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to you all that you sayest; for all the city of my people doth know that you art a worthy woman. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Tarry this night, and it will be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsmanâ€™s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Jehovah liveth: lie down until the morning.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon you, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six <span class="add">measures</span> of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And she said, These six <span class="add">measures</span> of barley gave he me; for he said, Go not empty to your mother-in-law. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
