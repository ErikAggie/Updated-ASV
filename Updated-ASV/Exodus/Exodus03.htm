And he said, Here am I. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place whereon you standest is holy ground. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good land and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me: moreover I have seen the oppression with what the Egyptians oppress them. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you will serve God upon this mountain.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and will say to them, The God of your fathers hath sent me to you; and they will say to me, What is his name? What will I say to them? <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me to you. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and <span class="add">seen </span> that which is done to you in Egypt: <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And they will hearken to your voice: and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us: and now let us go, we pray you, three daysâ€™ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it will come to pass, that, when you go, you will not go empty. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But every woman will ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and you will put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and you will despoil the Egyptians.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
