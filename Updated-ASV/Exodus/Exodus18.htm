why sittest you yourself alone, and all the people stand about you from morning to even? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God: <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>when they have a matter, they come to me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Moses’ father-in-law said to him, The thing that you doest is not good. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>You wilt surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you: for the thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it yourself alone. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Hearken now to my voice, I will give you counsel, and God be with you: be you for the people to God-ward, and bring you the causes to God: <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>and you shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of yousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it will be, that every great matter they will bring to you, but every small matter they will judge themselves: so will it be easier for yourself, and they will bear <span class="add">the burden</span> with you. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>If you shall do this thing, and God command you so, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
