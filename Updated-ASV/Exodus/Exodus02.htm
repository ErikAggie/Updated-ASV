And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child’s mother. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge <span class="add">of them</span>.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
