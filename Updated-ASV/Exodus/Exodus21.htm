the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door, or to the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And if he espouse her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>If he take him another <span class="add">wife</span>; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And if he do not these three things to her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver <span class="add">him</span> into his hand; then I will appoint you a place whither he shall flee. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; you shall take him from mine altar, that he may die.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But if any harm follow, then you shall give life for life, <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And if he smite out his man-servant’s tooth, or his maid-servant’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein, <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money to the owner thereof, and the dead <span class="add">beast</span> shall be his.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it: and the dead also they shall divide. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead <span class="add">beast</span> shall be his own.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
