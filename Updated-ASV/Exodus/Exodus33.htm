And it came to pass, that every one that sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting, which was without the camp. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and <span class="add">Jehovah </span> spoke with Moses. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to Jehovah, See, you sayest to me, Bring up this people: and you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found favor in your sight, show me now your ways, that I may know you, to the end that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he said, My presence will go <span class="add">with thee</span>, and I will give you rest. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, If your presence go not <span class="add">with me</span>, carry us not up hence. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For wherein now will it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? is it not in that you goest with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And he said, Show me, I pray you, your glory. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he said, You cannot see my face; for man will not see me and live. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand upon the rock: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>and it will come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by: <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face will not be seen.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
