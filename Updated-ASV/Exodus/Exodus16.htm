For they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Gather you of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, will you take it, every man for them that are in his tent. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to them, Let no man leave of it until the morning. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Notwithstanding they hearkened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was wroth with them. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, This is that which Jehovah hath spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath to Jehovah: bake that which you will bake, and boil that which you will boil; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And they laid it up until the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm therein. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath to Jehovah: to-day you will not find it in the field. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Six days you will gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there will be none. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, How long refuse you to keep my commandments and my laws? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>See, for that Jehovah hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>So the people rested on the seventh day.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers <span class="add">made </span> with honey. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with what I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
