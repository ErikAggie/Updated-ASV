and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But Pharaoh will not hearken to you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Moses and Aaron did so; as Jehovah commanded them, so did they. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a wonder for you; then you shall say to Aaron, Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Jehovah had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers: and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not to them; as Jehovah had spoken.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn, he refuseth to let the people go. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Get you to Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out to the water; and you shall stand by the river’s brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And you shall say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath sent me to you, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto you have not hearkened. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, In this you shall know that I am Jehovah: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood;
