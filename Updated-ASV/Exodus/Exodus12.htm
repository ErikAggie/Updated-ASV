according to every man’s eating you will make your count for the lamb. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Your lamb will be without blemish, a male a year old: you will take it from the sheep, or from the goats: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and you will keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel will kill it at even. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And they will take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they will eat it. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they will eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they will eat it. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And you will let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning you will burn with fire. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And thus will you eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you will eat it in haste: it is Jehovah’s passover. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the blood will be to you for a token upon the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there will no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And this day will be to you for a memorial, and you will keep it a feast to Jehovah: throughout your generations you will keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Seven days will you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you will put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul will be cut off from Israel. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And in the first day there will be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work will be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And you will observe the <span class="add">feast of</span> unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore will you observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>In the first <span class="add">month</span>, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, you will eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Seven days will there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>You will eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations will you eat unleavened bread.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And you will take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you will go out of the door of his house until the morning. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And you will observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons for ever. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, when you are come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as he hath promised, that you will keep this service. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, when your children will say to you, What mean you by this service? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>that you will say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovah’s passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel went and did so; as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as you have said. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>It is a night to be much observed to Jehovah for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of Jehovah, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there will no foreigner eat thereof; <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>but every man’s servant that is bought for money, when you hast circumcised him, then will he eat thereof. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>A sojourner and a hired servant will not eat thereof. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>In one house will it be eaten; you shall not carry forth anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither will you break a bone thereof. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>All the congregation of Israel will keep it. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And when a stranger will sojourn with you, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he will be as one that is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person will eat thereof. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>One law will be to him that is home-born, and to the stranger that sojourneth among you. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>Thus did all the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
