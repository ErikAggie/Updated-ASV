And he said, A rod. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail: (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand:) <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>That they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to you. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said furthermore to him, Put now your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as <span class="add">white as</span> snow. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he said, Put your hand into your bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his <span class="add">other</span> flesh.) <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, if they will not believe you, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which you takest out of the river will become blood upon the dry land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to him, Who hath made manâ€™s mouth? Or who maketh <span class="add">a man</span> dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray you, by the hand of him whom you will send. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes to meet you: and when he seeth you, he will be glad in his heart. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And you shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you will do. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he will be your spokesman to the people; and it will come to pass, that he will be to you a mouth, and you shall be to him as God. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And you shall take in your hand this rod, with what you shall do the signs. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray you, and return to my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought your life. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, When you goest back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand: but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, Israel is my son, my first-born: <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and I have said to you, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and you have refused to let him go: behold, I will slay your son, your first-born. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood art you to me. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>So he let him alone.
