Moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them, <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>and spoke to them, saying, Return with much wealth to your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And when they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertaineth to the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers’ houses among the thousands of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the whole congregation of Jehovah, What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that you have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against Jehovah? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of Jehovah, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>that you must turn away this day from following Jehovah? and it will be, seeing you rebel to-day against Jehovah, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass you over to the land of the possession of Jehovah, wherein Jehovah’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel, <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, the Mighty One, God, Jehovah, he knoweth; and Israel he will know: if it be in rebellion, or if in trespass against Jehovah (save you us not this day), <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Jehovah; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let Jehovah himself require it; <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>and if we have not <span class="add">rather</span> out of carefulness done this, <span class="add">and</span> of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>for Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no portion in Jehovah: so might your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>but it will be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, You have no portion in Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Therefore said we, It will be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we will say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn away this day from following Jehovah, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because you have not committed this trespass against Jehovah: now have you delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar <span class="add">Ed</span>: For, <span class="add">said they</span>, it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
