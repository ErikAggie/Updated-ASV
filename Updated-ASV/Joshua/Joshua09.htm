And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye? <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt, <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy: <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>and these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel.
