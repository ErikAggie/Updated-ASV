As for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>So <span class="add">the lot</span> was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons.
