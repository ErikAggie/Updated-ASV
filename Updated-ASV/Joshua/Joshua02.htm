And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to you, that are entered into your house; for they are come to search out all the land. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came to me, but I knew not whence they were: <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for you will overtake them. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And before they were laid down, she came up to them upon the roof; <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>and she said to the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that the fear of you is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyoud. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token; <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>and that you will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the men said to her, Our life for yours, if you utter not this our business; and it will be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And she said to them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may you go your way. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the men said to her, We will be guiltless of this your oath which you hast made us to swear. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you didst let us down by: and you shall gather to you into the house your father, and your mother, and your brethren, and all your father’s household. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And it will be, that whosoever will go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever will be with you in the house, his blood will be on our head, if any hand be upon him. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But if you utter this our business, then we will be guiltless of your oath which you hast made us to swear. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And they said to Joshua, Truly Jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
