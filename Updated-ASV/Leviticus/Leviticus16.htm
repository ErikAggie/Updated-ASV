<span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>and Jehovah said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Herewith will Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>He will put on the holy linen coat, and he will have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and will be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre will he be attired: they are the holy garments; and he will bathe his flesh in water, and put them on. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he will take of the congregation of the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Aaron will present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he will take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Aaron will cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for Azazel. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Aaron will present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer him for a sin-offering. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, will be set alive before Jehovah, to make atonement for him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Aaron will present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and will make atonement for himself, and for his house, and will kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he will take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil: <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>and he will put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and he will take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat on the east;
