<span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath to Jehovah: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>That which groweth of itself of your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for you, and for your servant and for your maid, and for your hired servant and for your stranger, who sojourn with you. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And for your cattle, and for the beasts that are in your land, shall all the increase thereof be for food.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And you shall number seven sabbaths of years to you, seven times seven years; and there shall be to you the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then shall you send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall you send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you: you shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather <span class="add">the grapes </span> in it of the undressed vines. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you: you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>In this year of jubilee you shall return every man to his possession. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And if you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy of your neighbor’s hand, you shall not wrong one another. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy of your neighbor, <span class="add">and</span> according to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>According to the multitude of the years you shall increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years you shall diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops does he sell to you. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And you shall not wrong one another; but you shall fear your God: for I am Jehovah your God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Wherefore you shall do my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And if you shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And you shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, you shall eat the old store.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for you are strangers and sojourners with me. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>If your brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next to him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it;

for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And if your brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with you; then you shall uphold him: <span class="add">as</span> a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with you. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Take you no interest of him or increase, but fear your God; that your brother may live with you. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>You shall not give him your money upon interest, nor give him your victuals for increase. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, <span class="add">and</span> to be your God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And if your brother be waxed poor with you, and sell himself to you;

of the nations that are round about you, of them shall you buy bondmen and bondmaids. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall you buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And you shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall you take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And if a stranger or sojourner with you be waxed rich, and your brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself to the stranger <span class="add">or </span> sojourner with you, or to the stock of the stranger’s family; <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him; <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin to him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>If there be yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years shall he give back the price of his redemption. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight. <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And if he be not redeemed by these <span class="add">means</span>, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him. <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>For to me the children of Israel are servants;
