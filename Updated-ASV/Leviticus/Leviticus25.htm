<span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>but in the seventh year will be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath to Jehovah: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>That which groweth of itself of your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather: it will be a year of solemn rest for the land. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the sabbath of the land will be for food for you; for you, and for your servant and for your maid, and for your hired servant and for your stranger, who sojourn with you. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And for your cattle, and for the beasts that are in your land, will all the increase thereof be for food.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And you shall number seven sabbaths of years to you, seven times seven years; and there will be to you the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then shall you send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement will you send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And you will hallow the fiftieth youar, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it will be a jubilee to you; and you will return every man to his possession, and you will return every man to his family. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>A jubilee will that fiftieth youar be to you: you will not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather <span class="add">the grapes </span> in it of the undressed vines. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For it is a jubilee; it will be holy to you: you will eat the increase thereof out of the field.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>In this youar of jubilee you will return every man to his possession. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And if you sell aught to your neighbor, or buy of your neighbor’s hand, you will not wrong one another. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy of your neighbor, <span class="add">and</span> according to the number of years of the crops he will sell to you. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>According to the multitude of the years you shall increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years you shall diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell to you. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And you will not wrong one another; but you shall fear your God: for I am Jehovah your God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Wherefore you will do my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; and you will dwell in the land in safety. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And if you will say, What will we eat the seventh youar? behold, we will not sow, nor gather in our increase; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it will bring forth fruit for the three years. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And you will sow the eighth youar, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth youar, until its fruits come in, you will eat the old store.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the land will not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for you are strangers and sojourners with me. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And in all the land of your possession you will grant a redemption for the land. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>If your brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then will his kinsman that is next to him come, and will redeem that which his brother hath sold. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus to the man to whom he sold it; and he will return to his possession. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold will remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it will go out, and he will return to his possession.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year will he have the right of redemption. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city will be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it will not go out in the jubilee. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them will be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they will go out in the jubilee. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, will go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And if your brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with you; then you shall uphold him: <span class="add">as</span> a stranger and a sojourner will he live with you. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Take you no interest of him or increase, but fear your God; that your brother may live with you. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>You shall not give him your money upon interest, nor give him your victuals for increase. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, <span class="add">and</span> to be your God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And if your brother be waxed poor with you, and sell himself to you; you shall not make him to serve as a bond-servant. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he will be with you; he will serve with you to the year of jubilee: <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>then will he go out from you, he and his children with him, and will return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers will he return. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they will not be sold as bondmen. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>You shall not rule over him with rigor, but shall fear your God. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And as for your bondmen, and your bondmaids, whom you shall have; of the nations that are round about you, of them will you buy bondmen and bondmaids. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them will you buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they will be your possession. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And you will make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them will you take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel you will not rule, one over another, with rigor.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And if a stranger or sojourner with you be waxed rich, and your brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself to the stranger <span class="add">or </span> sojourner with you, or to the stock of the stranger’s family; <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him; <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin to him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And he will reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale will be according to the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant will he be with him. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>If there be yet many years, according to them he will give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he will reckon with him; according to his years will he give back the price of his redemption. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>As a servant hired year by year will he be with him: he will not rule with rigor over him in your sight. <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And if he be not redeemed by these <span class="add">means</span>, then he will go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him. <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
