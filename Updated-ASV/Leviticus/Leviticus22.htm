And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>the soul that toucheth any such will be unclean until the even, and will not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when the sun is down, he will be clean; and afterward he will eat of the holy things, because it is his bread. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he will not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>They will therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>There will no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest’s, or a hired servant, will not eat of the holy thing. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he will eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they will eat of his bread. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And if a priest’s daughter be married to a stranger, she will not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she will eat of her father’s bread: but there will no stranger eat thereof. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he will put the fifth part thereof to it, and will give to the priest the holy thing. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And they will not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer to Jehovah, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>and <span class="add">so</span> cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spake to Moses, saying, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer to Jehovah for a burnt-offering; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>that you may be accepted, <span class="add">you will offer</span> a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But whatsoever hath a blemish, that will you not offer: for it will not be acceptable for you. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it will be perfect to be accepted; there will be no blemish therein. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, you will not offer these to Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest you offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it will not be accepted. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, you will not offer to Jehovah; neither will you do <span class="add">thus</span> in your land. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Neither from the hand of a foreigner will you offer the bread of your God of any of these;

and from the eighth day and thenceforth it will be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And whether it be cow or ewe, you will not kill it and its young both in one day. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah, you will sacrifice it that you may be accepted. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>On the same day it will be eaten; you will leave none of it until the morning: I am Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Therefore will you keep my commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And you will not profane my holy name;
