And Aaron held his peace. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that you die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And you will not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you.
