he will surely be put to death: the people of the land will stone him with stones. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed to Molech, and put him not to death; <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that play the harlot after him, to play the harlot with Molech, from among their people.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the soul that turneth to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards, to play the harlot after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be you holy; for I am Jehovah your God. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And you will keep my statutes, and do them: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For every one that curseth his father or his mother will surely be put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood will be upon him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress will surely be put to death. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his father’s nakedness: both of them will surely be put to death; their blood will be upon them. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them will surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood will be upon them. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they will surely be put to death; their blood will be upon them. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they will be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And if a man lie with a beast, he will surely be put to death: and you will slay the beast. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And if a woman approach to any beast, and lie down thereto, you shall kill the woman, and the beast: they will surely be put to death; their blood will be upon them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And if a man will take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they will be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he will bear his iniquity. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And if a man will lie with a woman having her sickness, and will uncover her nakedness; he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them will be cut off from among their people. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, nor of your father’s sister; for he hath made naked his near kin: they will bear their iniquity. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And if a man will lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle’s nakedness: they will bear their sin; they will die childless. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And if a man will take his brother’s wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they will be childless.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Ye will therefore keep all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them; that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And you will not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But I have said to you, Ye will inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Jehovah your God, who hath separated you from the peoples. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Ye will therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and you will not make your souls abominable by beast, or by bird, or by anything wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separated from you as unclean. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And you will be holy to me: for I, Jehovah, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that you should be mine.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, will surely be put to death: they will stone them with stones; their blood will be upon them.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
