when he knoweth of it, then he will be guilty. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Or if any one swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man will utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he will be guilty in one of these <span class="add">things</span>. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And it will be, when he will be guilty in one of these <span class="add">things</span>, that he will confess that wherein he hath sinned: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and he will bring his trespass-offering to Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he will bring his trespass-offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to Jehovah;

for it is a sin-offering. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he will bring it to the priest, and the priest will take his handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: it is a sin-offering. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the priest will make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he will be forgiven: and <span class="add">the remnant</span> will be the priestâ€™s, as the meal-offering.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spake to Moses, saying, <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>If any one commit a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Jehovah;
