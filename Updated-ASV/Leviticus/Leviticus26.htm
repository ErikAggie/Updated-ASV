<span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time; and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And you shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And you shall eat old store long kept, and you shall bring forth the old because of the new. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their bondmen;

and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And I will set my face against you, and you shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and you shall flee when none pursueth you. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And if you will not yet for these things hearken to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;

and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and you are in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when you dwelt upon it. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me, <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity; <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God; <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
