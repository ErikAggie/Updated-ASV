Thus did Job continually.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house, <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>and the Sabeans fell <span class="add">upon them</span>, and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and he said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
