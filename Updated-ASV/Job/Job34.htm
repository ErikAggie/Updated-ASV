said,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Hear my words, you wise men;</div><div class="q" >And give ear to me, you that have knowledge.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For the ear trieth words,</div><div class="q" >As the palate tasteth food.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Let us choose for us that which is right:</div><div class="q" >Let us know among ourselves what is good.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For Job hath said, I am righteous,</div><div class="q" >And God hath taken away my right:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Notwithstanding my right I am <span class="add">accounted</span> a liar;</div><div class="q" >My wound is incurable, <span class="add">though I am</span> without transgression.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>What man is like Job,</div><div class="q" >Who drinketh up scoffing like water,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,</div><div class="q" >And walketh with wicked men?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing</div><div class="q" >That he should delight himself with God.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore hearken to me, you men of understanding:</div><div class="q" >Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,</div><div class="q" >And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For the work of a man will he render to him,</div><div class="q" >And cause every man to find according to his ways.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Yes, of a surety, God will not do wickedly,</div><div class="q" >Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Who gave him a charge over the earth?</div><div class="q" >Or who hath disposed the whole world?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>If he set his heart upon himself,</div><div class="q" ><span class="add">If</span> he gather to himself his spirit and his breath;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>All flesh shall perish together,</div><div class="q" >And man shall turn again to dust.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>If now <span class="add">you hast</span> understanding, hear this:</div><div class="q" >Hearken to the voice of my words.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Shall even one that hateth justice govern?</div><div class="q" >And wilt you condemn him that is righteous <span class="add">and</span> mighty?â€”</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">Him</span> that saith to a king, <span class="add">You art</span> vile,</div><div class="q" ><span class="add">Or</span> to nobles, <span class="add">You are</span> wicked;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>That respecteth not the persons of princes,</div><div class="q" >Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor;</div><div class="q" >For they all are the work of his hands.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>In a moment they die, even at midnight;</div><div class="q" >The people are shaken and pass away,</div><div class="q" >And the mighty are taken away without hand.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For his eyes are upon the ways of a man,</div><div class="q" >And he seeth all his goings.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,</div><div class="q" >Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For he needeth not further to consider a man,</div><div class="q" >That he should go before God in judgment.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>He breaketh in pieces mighty men <span class="add">in ways</span> past finding out,</div><div class="q" >And setteth others in their stead.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works;</div><div class="q" >And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>He striketh them as wicked men</div><div class="q" >In the open sight of others;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Because they turned aside from following him,</div><div class="q" >And would not have regard in any of his ways:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him,</div><div class="q" >And he heard the cry of the afflicted.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn?</div><div class="q" >And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?</div><div class="q" >Alike whether <span class="add">it be done</span> to a nation, or to a man:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>That the godless man reign not,</div><div class="q" >That there be none to ensnare the people.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For hath any said to God,</div><div class="q" >I have borne <span class="add">chastisement</span>, I will not offend <span class="add">any more</span>:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>That which I see not teach you me:</div><div class="q" >If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Shall his recompense be as you will, that you refusest it?</div><div class="q" >For you must choose, and not I:</div><div class="q" >Therefore speak what you knowest.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Men of understanding will say to me,</div><div class="q" >Yes, every wise man that heareth me:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Job speaketh without knowledge,</div><div class="q" >And his words are without wisdom.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Would that Job were tried to the end,</div><div class="q" >Because of his answering like wicked men.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For he addeth rebellion to his sin;</div><div class="q" >He clappeth his hands among us,</div><div class="q" >And multiplieth his words against God.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
