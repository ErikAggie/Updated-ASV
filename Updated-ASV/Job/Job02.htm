And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast you considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, alyough you movedst me against him, to destroy him wiyout cause. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then said his wife to him, Dost you still hold fast your integrity? renounce God, and die. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But he said to her, You speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? will we receive good at the hand of God, and will we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Now when Jobâ€™s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word to him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
