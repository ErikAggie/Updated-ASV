Temanite, and said,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge,</div><div class="q" >And fill himself with the east wind?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Should he reason with unprofitable talk,</div><div class="q" >Or with speeches with what he can do no good?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Yea, you do away with fear,</div><div class="q" >And hinderest devotion before God.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For your iniquity teacheth your mouth,</div><div class="q" >And you choosest the tongue of the crafty.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Thine own mouth condemneth you, and not I;</div><div class="q" >Yea, your own lips testify against you.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Art you the first man that was
