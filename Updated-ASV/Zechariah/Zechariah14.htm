and the city will be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city will go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people will not be cut off from the city. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Then will Jehovah go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And his feet will stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the mount of Olives will be cleft in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, <span class="add">and there will be </span> a very great valley; and half of the mountain will remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And you will flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; youa, you will flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and Jehovah my God will come, and all the holy ones with you. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass in that day, that there will not be light; the bright ones will withdraw themselves: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>but it will be one day which is known to Jehovah; not day, and not night; but it will come to pass, that at evening time there will be light. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass in that day, that living waters will go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter will it be.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah will be King over all the earth: in that day will Jehovah be one, and his name one. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up, and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king’s wine-presses. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And men will dwell therein, and there will be no more curse; but Jerusalem will dwell safely.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And this will be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh will consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes will consume away in their sockets, and their tongue will consume away in their mouth. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from Jehovah will be among them; and they will lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about will be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And so will be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that will be in those camps, as that plague.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And it will be, that whoso of <span class="add">all</span> the families of the earth goeth not up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there will be no rain. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, neither <span class="add">will it be</span> upon them; there will be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>In that day will there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLY UNTO JEHOVAH; and the pots in Jehovah’s house will be like the bowls before the altar. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Jehovah of hosts; and all they that sacrifice will come and take of them, and boil therein: and in that day there will be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
