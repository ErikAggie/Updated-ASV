Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But to the married I give charge, <span class="add">yea</span> not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such <span class="add">cases</span>: but God hath called us in peace. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For how knowest you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how knowest you, O husband, whether you shall save your wife? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Wast you called being a bondservant? care not for it: nay, even if you can become free, use <span class="add">it</span> rather. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>You were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, <span class="add">namely,</span> that it is good for a man to be as he is. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Art you bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art you loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But should you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none; <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not; <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>and is divided. <span class="add">So</span> also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin <span class="add">daughter</span>, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching his own will, and hath determined this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin <span class="add">daughter</span>, shall do well. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>So then both he that giveth his own virgin <span class="add">daughter</span> in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
