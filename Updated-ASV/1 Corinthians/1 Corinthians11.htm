What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as you drink <span class="add">it</span>, in remembrance of me. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For as often as you eat this bread, and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till he come. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, if he discern not the body. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait one for another. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not to judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
