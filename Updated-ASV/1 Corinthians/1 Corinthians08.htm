Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know; <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is <span class="add">anything</span> in the world, and that there is no God but one. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as <span class="add">of</span> a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idolâ€™s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
