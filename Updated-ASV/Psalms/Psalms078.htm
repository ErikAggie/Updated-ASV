class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Give ear, O my people, to my law:</div><div class="q" >Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I will open my mouth in a parable;</div><div class="q" >I will utter dark sayings of old,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Which we have heard and known,</div><div class="q" >And our fathers have told us.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>We will not hide them from their children,</div><div class="q" >Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah,</div><div class="q" >And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For he established a testimony in Jacob,</div><div class="q" >And appointed a law in Israel,</div><div class="q" >Which he commanded our fathers,</div><div class="q" >That they should make them known to their children;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>That the generation to come might know <span class="add">them</span>, even the children that should be born;</div><div class="q" >Who should arise and tell <span class="add">them</span> to their children,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>That they might set their hope in God,</div><div class="q" >And not forget the works of God,</div><div class="q" >But keep his commandments,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And might not be as their fathers,</div><div class="q" >A stubborn and rebellious generation,</div><div class="q" >A generation that set not their heart aright,</div><div class="q" >And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,</div><div class="q" >Turned back in the day of battle.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>They kept not the covenant of God,</div><div class="q" >And refused to walk in his law;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And they forgat his doings,</div><div class="q" >And his wondrous works that he had showed them.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers,</div><div class="q" >In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through;</div><div class="q" >And he made the waters to stand as a heap.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>In the day-time also he led them with a cloud,</div><div class="q" >And all the night with a light of fire.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>He clave rocks in the wilderness,</div><div class="q" >And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>He brought streams also out of the rock,</div><div class="q" >And caused waters to run down like rivers.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Yet went they on still to sin against him,</div><div class="q" >To rebel against the Most High in the desert.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And they tempted God in their heart</div><div class="q" >By asking food according to their desire.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Yea, they spoke against God;</div><div class="q" >They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out,</div><div class="q" >And streams overflowed;</div><div class="q" >Can he give bread also?</div><div class="q" >Will he provide flesh for his people?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth;</div><div class="q" >And a fire was kindled against Jacob,</div><div class="q" >And anger also went up against Israel;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Because they believed not in God,</div><div class="q" >And trusted not in his salvation.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Yet he commanded the skies above,</div><div class="q" >And opened the doors of heaven;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he rained down manna upon them to eat,</div><div class="q" >And gave them food from heaven.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Man did eat the bread of the mighty:</div><div class="q" >He sent them food to the full.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens;</div><div class="q" >And by his power he guided the south wind.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>He rained flesh also upon them as the dust,</div><div class="q" >And winged birds as the sand of the seas:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he let it fall in the midst of their camp,</div><div class="q" >Round about their habitations.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>So they did eat, and were well filled;</div><div class="q" >And he gave them their own desire.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>They were not estranged from that which they desired,</div><div class="q" >Their food was yet in their mouths,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>When the anger of God went up against them,</div><div class="q" >And slew of the fattest of them,</div><div class="q" >And smote down the young men of Israel.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For all this they sinned still,</div><div class="q" >And believed not in his wondrous works.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,</div><div class="q" >And their years in terror.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>When he slew them, then they inquired after him;</div><div class="q" >And they returned and sought God earnestly.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And they remembered that God was their rock,</div><div class="q" >And the Most High God their redeemer.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>But they flattered him with their mouth,</div><div class="q" >And lied to him with their tongue.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For their heart was not right with him,</div><div class="q" >Neither were they faithful in his covenant.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>But he, being merciful, forgave <span class="add">their</span> iniquity, and destroyed <span class="add">them</span> not:</div><div class="q" >Yea, many a time turned he his anger away,</div><div class="q" >And did not stir up all his wrath.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And he remembered that they were but flesh,</div><div class="q" >A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness,</div><div class="q" >And grieve him in the desert!</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And they turned again and tempted God,</div><div class="q" >And provoked the Holy One of Israel.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>They remembered not his hand,</div><div class="q" >Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>How he set his signs in Egypt,</div><div class="q" >And his wonders in the field of Zoan,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And turned their rivers into blood,</div><div class="q" >And their streams, so that they could not drink.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;</div><div class="q" >And frogs, which destroyed them.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,</div><div class="q" >And their labor to the locust.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>He destroyed their vines with hail,</div><div class="q" >And their sycomore-trees with frost.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>He gave over their cattle also to the hail,</div><div class="q" >And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger,</div><div class="q" >Wrath, and indignation, and trouble,</div><div class="q" >A band of angels of evil.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>He made a path for his anger;</div><div class="q" >He spared not their soul from death,</div><div class="q" >But gave their life over to the pestilence,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And smote all the first-born in Egypt,</div><div class="q" >The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>But he led forth his own people like sheep,</div><div class="q" >And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>And he led them safely, so that they feared not;</div><div class="q" >But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,</div><div class="q" >To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>He drove out the nations also before them,</div><div class="q" >And allotted them for an inheritance by line,</div><div class="q" >And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,</div><div class="q" >And kept not his testimonies;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers:</div><div class="q" >They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places,</div><div class="q" >And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>When God heard <span class="add">this</span>, he was wroth,</div><div class="q" >And greatly abhorred Israel;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,</div><div class="q" >The tent which he placed among men;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>And delivered his strength into captivity,</div><div class="q" >And his glory into the adversary’s hand.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>He gave his people over also to the sword,</div><div class="q" >And was wroth with his inheritance.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>Fire devoured their young men;</div><div class="q" >And their virgins had no marriage-song.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>Their priests fell by the sword;</div><div class="q" >And their widows made no lamentation.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,</div><div class="q" >Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span>And he smote his adversaries backward:</div><div class="q" >He put them to a perpetual reproach.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V67">67&nbsp;</span>Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph,</div><div class="q" >And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V68">68&nbsp;</span>But chose the tribe of Judah,</div><div class="q" >The mount Zion which he loved.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V69">69&nbsp;</span>And he built his sanctuary like the heights,</div><div class="q" >Like the earth which he hath established for ever.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V70">70&nbsp;</span>He chose David also his servant,</div><div class="q" >And took him from the sheepfolds:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V71">71&nbsp;</span>From following the ewes that have their young he brought him,</div><div class="q" >To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V72">72&nbsp;</span>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,</div><div class="q" >And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard
