Psalm</span> of David the servant of Jehovah, who spake to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he said,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>I love you, O Jehovah, my strength.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</div><div class="q" >My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge;</div><div class="q" >My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised:</div><div class="q" >So will I be saved from mine enemies.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>The cords of death compassed me,</div><div class="q" >And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The cords of Sheol were round about me;</div><div class="q" >The snares of death came upon me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>In my distress I called upon Jehovah,</div><div class="q" >And cried to my God:</div><div class="q" >He heard my voice out of his temple,</div><div class="q" >And my cry before him came into his ears.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then the earth shook and trembled;</div><div class="q" >The foundations also of the mountains quaked</div><div class="q" >And were shaken, because he was wroth.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,</div><div class="q" >And fire out of his mouth devoured:</div><div class="q" >Coals were kindled by it.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down;</div><div class="q" >And thick darkness was under his feet.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly;</div><div class="q" >Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him,</div><div class="q" >Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,</div><div class="q" >Hailstones and coals of fire.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Jehovah also thundered in the heavens,</div><div class="q" >And the Most High uttered his voice,</div><div class="q" >Hailstones and coals of fire.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them;</div><div class="q" >Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then the channels of waters appeared,</div><div class="q" >And the foundations of the world were laid bare,</div><div class="q" >At your rebuke, O Jehovah,</div><div class="q" >At the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>He sent from on high, he took me;</div><div class="q" >He drew me out of many waters.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He delivered me from my strong enemy,</div><div class="q" >And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>They came upon me in the day of my calamity;</div><div class="q" >But Jehovah was my stay.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>He brought me forth also into a large place;</div><div class="q" >He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness;</div><div class="q" >According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,</div><div class="q" >And have not wickedly departed from my God.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For all his ordinances were before me,</div><div class="q" >And I put not away his statutes from me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>I was also perfect with him,</div><div class="q" >And I kept myself from mine iniquity.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness,</div><div class="q" >According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>With the merciful you will show yourself merciful;</div><div class="q" >With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>With the pure you will show yourself pure;</div><div class="q" >And with the perverse you will show yourself froward.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For you will save the afflicted people;</div><div class="q" >But the haughty eyes you will bring down.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For you will light my lamp:</div><div class="q" >Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For by you I run upon a troop;</div><div class="q" >And by my God do I leap over a wall.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>As for God, his way is perfect:</div><div class="q" >The word of Jehovah is tried;</div><div class="q" >He is a shield to all them that take refuge in him.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For who is God, save Jehovah?</div><div class="q" >And who is a rock, besides our God,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>The God that girdeth me with strength,</div><div class="q" >And maketh my way perfect?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>He maketh my feet like hindsâ€™ <span class="add">feet</span>:</div><div class="q" >And setteth me upon my high places.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>He teacheth my hands to war;</div><div class="q" >So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>You hast also given me the shield of your salvation;</div><div class="q" >And your right hand hath holden me up,</div><div class="q" >And your gentleness hath made me great.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>You hast enlarged my steps under me,</div><div class="q" >And my feet have not slipped.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them;</div><div class="q" >Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>I will smite them through, so that they will not be able to rise:</div><div class="q" >They will fall under my feet.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>For you hast girded me with strength to the battle:</div><div class="q" >You hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>You hast also made mine enemies turn their backs to me,</div><div class="q" >That I might cut off them that hate me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>They cried, but there was none to save;</div><div class="q" >Even to Jehovah, but he answered them not.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind;</div><div class="q" >I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>You hast delivered me from the strivings of the people;</div><div class="q" >You hast made me the head of the nations:</div><div class="q" >A people whom I have not known will serve me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>As soon as they hear of me they will obey me;</div><div class="q" >The foreigners will submit themselves to me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>The foreigners will fade away,</div><div class="q" >And will come trembling out of their close places.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock;</div><div class="q" >And exalted be the God of my salvation,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,</div><div class="q" >And subdueth peoples under me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>He rescueth me from mine enemies;</div><div class="q" >Yea, you liftest me up above them that rise up against me;</div><div class="q" >You deliverest me from the violent man.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will give thanks to you, O Jehovah, among the nations,</div><div class="q" >And will sing praises to your name.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>Great deliverance giveth he to his king,</div><div class="q" >And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed,</div><div class="q" >To David and to his seed, for evermore.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
