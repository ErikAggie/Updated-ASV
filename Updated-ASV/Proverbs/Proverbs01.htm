><span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>To know wisdom and instruction;</div><div class="q" >To discern the words of understanding;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>To receive instruction in wise dealing,</div><div class="q" >In righteousness and justice and equity;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>To give prudence to the simple,</div><div class="q" >To the young man knowledge and discretion:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;</div><div class="q" >And that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsels:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>To understand a proverb, and a figure,</div><div class="q" >The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge;</div><div class="q" ><span class="add">But</span> the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>My son, hear the instruction of your father,</div><div class="q" >And forsake not the law of your mother:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For they will be a chaplet of grace to your head,</div><div class="q" >And chains about your neck.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>My son, if sinners entice you,</div><div class="q" >Consent you not.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>If they say, Come with us,</div><div class="q" >Let us lay wait for blood;</div><div class="q" >Let us lurk privately for the innocent without cause;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol,</div><div class="q" >And whole, as those that go down into the pit;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>We will find all precious substance;</div><div class="q" >We will fill our houses with spoil;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Thou shall cast your lot among us;</div><div class="q" >We will all have one purse:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>My son, walk not you in the way with them;</div><div class="q" >Refrain your foot from their path:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For their feet run to evil,</div><div class="q" >And they make haste to shed blood.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For in vain is the net spread</div><div class="q" >In the sight of any bird:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And these lay wait for their own blood;</div><div class="q" >They lurk privately for their own lives.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;</div><div class="q" >It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Wisdom crieth aloud in the street;</div><div class="q" >She uttereth her voice in the broad places;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>She crieth in the chief place of concourse;</div><div class="q" >At the entrance of the gates,</div><div class="q" >In the city, she uttereth her words:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?</div><div class="q" >And scoffers delight them in scoffing,</div><div class="q" >And fools hate knowledge?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Turn you at my reproof:</div><div class="q" >Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you;</div><div class="q" >I will make known my words to you.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Because I have called, and you have refused;</div><div class="q" >I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But you have set at nought all my counsel,</div><div class="q" >And would none of my reproof:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I also will laugh in <span class="add">the day of</span> your calamity;</div><div class="q" >I will mock when your fear cometh;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>When your fear cometh as a storm,</div><div class="q" >And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind;</div><div class="q" >When distress and anguish come upon you.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer;</div><div class="q" >They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For that they hated knowledge,</div><div class="q" >And did not choose the fear of Jehovah,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>They would none of my counsel,</div><div class="q" >They despised all my reproof.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Therefore will they eat of the fruit of their own way,</div><div class="q" >And be filled with their own devices.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For the backsliding of the simple will slay them,</div><div class="q" >And the careless ease of fools will destroy them.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>But whoso hearkeneth to me will dwell securely,</div><div class="q" >And will be quiet without fear of evil.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American
