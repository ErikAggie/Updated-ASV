A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I <span class="add">counsel thee</span>, Keep the king’s command, and that in regard of the oath of God. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For the king’s word <span class="add">hath</span> power; and who may say to him, What do you? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Whoso keepeth the commandment will know no evil thing; and a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because the misery of man is great upon him: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>for he knoweth not that which will be; for who can tell him how it will be? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war: neither will wickedness deliver him that is given to it. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>All this have I seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: <span class="add">there is</span> a time wherein one man hath power over another to his hurt. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>So I saw the wicked buried, and they came <span class="add">to the grave</span>; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his <span class="add">days</span>, yet surely I know that it will be well with them that fear God, that fear before him: <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>but it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong <span class="add">his</span> days, <span class="add">which are</span> as a shadow; because he feareth not before God. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that will abide with him in his labor <span class="add">all</span> the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes), <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labor to seek it out, yet he will not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet will he not be able to find it.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
