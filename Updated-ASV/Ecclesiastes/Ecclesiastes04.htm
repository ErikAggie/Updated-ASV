This also is vanity and a striving after wind. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, <span class="add">saith he</span>, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm <span class="add">alone</span>? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
