And Jesus saith to them, Yea: did you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you hast perfected praise? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith to it, Let there be no fruit from you henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered and said to them, Verily I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you will not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if you will say to this mountain, Be you taken up and cast into the sea, it will be done. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And all things, whatsoever you will ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we will say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But if we will say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But what think you? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I <span class="add">go</span>, sir: and went not. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith to them, Verily I say to you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and you, when you saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that you might believe him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did to them in like manner. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>When therefore the lord of the vineyard will come, what will he do to those husbandmen? <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>They say to him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render him the fruits in their seasons. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith to them, Did you never read in the scriptures,</div><div class="q" >The stone which the builders rejected,</div><div class="q" >The same was made the head of the corner;</div><div class="q" >This was from the Lord,</div><div class="q" >And it is marvellous in our eyes?</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Therefore say I to you, The kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And he that falleth on this stone will be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
