Behold, they that wear soft <span class="add">raiment</span> are in kingsâ€™ houses. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But wherefore went you out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>This is he, of whom it is written,</div><div class="q" >Behold, I send my messenger before your face,</div><div class="q" >Who will prepare your way before you.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Verily I say to you, Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence take it by force. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And if you are willing to receive <span class="add">it,</span> this is Elijah, that is to come. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But whereunto will I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their fellows <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>and say, We piped to you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not mourn. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her works.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And you, Capernaum, shall you be exalted to heaven? you shall go down to Hades: for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>At that season Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them to babes: <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>All things have been delivered to me of my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal <span class="add">him.</span> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you will find rest to your souls. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
