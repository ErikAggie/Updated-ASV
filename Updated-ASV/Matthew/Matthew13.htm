This is he that was sown by the way side. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his field: <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, didst you not sow good seed in your field? whence then hath it tares? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say to him, Wilt you then that we go and gather them up? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But he saith, Nay; lest haply while you gather up the tares, you root up the wheat with them. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Another parable spake he to them; The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>All these things spake Jesus in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing to them: <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,</div><div class="q" >I will open my mouth in parables;</div><div class="q" >I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil <span class="add">one</span>; <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be in the end of the world. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>The Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity, <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>and will cast them into the furnace of fire: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Then will the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>The kingdom of heaven is like to a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls: <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>So will it be in the end of the world: the angels will come, and sever the wicked from among the righteous, <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>and will cast them into the furnace of fire: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Have you understood all these things? They say to him, Yea. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed there.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>Is not this the carpenterâ€™s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house. <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
