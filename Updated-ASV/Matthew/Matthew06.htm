Verily I say to you, They have received their reward. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>But when you doest alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand doeth: <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>that thine alms may be in secret: and your Father who seeth in secret will recompense you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And when you pray, you will not be as the hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say to you, They have received their reward. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But you, when you prayest, enter into thine inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who seeth in secret will recompense you. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Be not therefore like to them: for your Father knoweth what things you have need of, before you ask him. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be your name. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Give us this day our daily bread. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil <span class="add">one.</span> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen of men to fast. Verily I say to you, They have received their reward. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But you, when you fastest, anoint your head, and wash your face; <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>that you be not seen of men to fast, but of your Father who is in secret: and your Father, who seeth in secret, will recompense you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal: <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, your whole body will be full of light. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But if thine eye be evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you be darkness, how great is the darkness! <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yout for your body, what you will put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not you of much more value than they? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to the measure of his life? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And why are you anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>yet I say to you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, <span class="add">will he</span> not much more <span class="add">clothe </span> you, O you of little faith? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Be not therefore anxious, saying, What will we eat? or, What will we drink? or, Wherewithal will we be clothed? <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all these things. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>But seek you first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be added to you. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
