And they weighed to him thirty pieces of silver. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him <span class="add">to them. </span></div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now on the first <span class="add">day</span> of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt you that we make ready for you to eat the passover? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at your house with my disciples. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you will betray me. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say to him every one, Is it I, Lord? <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him, You have said.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink you all of it; <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many to remission of sins. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fatherâ€™s kingdom.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Then saith Jesus to them, All you will be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered abroad. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>But Peter answered and said to him, If all will be offended in you, I will never be offended. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, Verily I say to you, that this night, before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Peter saith to him, Even if I must die with you, <span class="add">yet</span> will I not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to his disciples, Sit you here, while I go yonder and pray. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: abide you here, and watch with me. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith to Peter, What, could you not watch with me one hour? <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, your will be done. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And while he yet spoke, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I will kiss, that is he: take him. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to him, Friend, <span class="add">do</span> that for which you are come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to him, Put up again your sword into its place: for all they that take the sword will perish with the sword. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>Or thinkest you that I cannot beseech my Father, and he will even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are you come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you took me not. <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>And they that had taken Jesus led him away to <span class="add">the house of </span> Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>But Peter followed him afar off, to the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end. <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death; <span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two, <span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. <span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>And the high priest stood up, and said to him, Answerest you nothing? what is it which these witness against you? <span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God. <span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Henceforth you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. <span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard the blasphemy: <span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span>what think you? They answered and said, He is worthy of death. <span class="verse" id="V67">67&nbsp;</span>Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands, <span class="verse" id="V68">68&nbsp;</span>saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ: who is he that struck you?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V69">69&nbsp;</span>Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came to him, saying, You also wast with Jesus the GalilÃ¦an. <span class="verse" id="V70">70&nbsp;</span>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what you sayest. <span class="verse" id="V71">71&nbsp;</span>And when he was gone out into the porch, another <span class="add">maid</span> saw him, and saith to them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. <span class="verse" id="V72">72&nbsp;</span>And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man. <span class="verse" id="V73">73&nbsp;</span>And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth you also art <span class="add">one</span> of them; for your speech maketh you known. <span class="verse" id="V74">74&nbsp;</span>Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew. <span class="verse" id="V75">75&nbsp;</span>And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.
