and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>But he answered and said to them, See you not all these things? verily I say to you, There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? and what <span class="add">will be</span> the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world? <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man lead you astray. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and will lead many astray. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you be not troubled: for <span class="add">these things</span> must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But all these things are the beginning of travail. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then will they deliver you up to tribulation, and will kill you: and you will be hated of all the nations for my name’s sake. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And then will many stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of the many will wax cold. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But he that endureth to the end, the same will be saved. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations; and then will the end come.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>When therefore you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth understand), <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains: <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house: <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And pray you that your flight be not in the winter, neither on a sabbath: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>for then will be great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect’s sake those days will be shortened. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Then if any man will say to you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Here; believe <span class="add">it</span> not. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For there will arise false Christs, and false prophets, and will show great signs and wonders; so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have told you beforehand. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>If therefore they will say to you, Behold, he is in the wilderness; go not forth: Behold, he is in the inner chambers; believe <span class="add">it</span> not. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For as the lightning comes from the east, and is seen even to the west; so will be the coming of the Son of man. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken: <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>and then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then will all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he will send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, you know that the summer is nigh; <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>even so you also, when you see all these things, know you that he is nigh, <span class="add">even</span> at the doors. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Verily I say to you, This generation will not pass away, until all these things be accomplished. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>But of that day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And as <span class="add">were</span> the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>and they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so will be the coming of the Son of man. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Then will two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left: <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>two women <span class="add">will be</span> grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Watch therefore: for you know not on what day your Lord cometh. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Therefore be you also ready; for in an hour that you think not the Son of man cometh.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath set over his household, to give them their food in due season? <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh will find so doing. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Verily I say to you, that he will set him over all that he hath. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>But if that evil servant will say in his heart, My lord tarrieth; <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>and will begin to beat his fellow-servants, and will eat and drink with the drunken; <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>the lord of that servant will come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>and will cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
