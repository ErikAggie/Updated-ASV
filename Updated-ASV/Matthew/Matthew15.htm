And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But he answered and said, I was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith: be it done to you even as you will. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And Jesus departed there, and came nigh to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them: <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And Jesus called to him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the disciples say to him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude? <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, How many loaves have you? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
