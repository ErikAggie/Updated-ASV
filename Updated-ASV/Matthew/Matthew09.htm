And he arose, and followed him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with the publicans and sinners? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But when he heard it, he said, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But go you and learn what <span class="add">this</span> means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice: for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples fast not? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And no man puts a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up takes from the garment, and a worse rent is made. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Neither do <span class="add">men</span> put new wine into old wine-skins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins perish: but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are preserved.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>While he spoke these things to them, behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay your hand upon her, and she will live. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Jesus arose, and followed him, and <span class="add">so did</span> his disciples. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And behold, a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>for she said within herself, If I but touch his garment, I will be made whole. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus came into the rulerâ€™s house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult, <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>he said, Give place: for the damsel is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And the fame concerning this went forth into all that land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And as Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, son of David. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And when he came into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yea, Lord. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done to you. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And their eyes were opened.
