Come you forth to meet him. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go you rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But he answered and said, Verily I say to you, I know you not. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Watch therefore, for you know not the day nor the hour.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For <span class="add">it is</span> as <span class="add">when</span> a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>In like manner he also that <span class="add">received</span> the two gained other two. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lordâ€™s money. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, you deliveredst to me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant: you hast been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter you into the joy of your lord. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And he also that <span class="add">received</span> the two talents came and said, Lord, you deliveredst to me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant: you hast been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter you into the joy of your lord. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you didst not sow, and gathering where you didst not scatter; <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth: lo, you hast your own. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But his lord answered and said to him, You wicked and slothful servant, you knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>you oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Take you away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath the ten talents. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For to every one that hath will be given, and he will have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath will be taken away. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And cast you out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>But when the Son of man will come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he sit on the throne of his glory: <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>and before him will be gathered all the nations: and he will separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats; <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>and he will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Then will the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>for I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in; <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Then will the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you hungry, and fed you? or athirst, and gave you drink? <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And when saw we you a stranger, and took you in? or naked, and clothed you? <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And when saw we you sick, or in prison, and came to you? <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And the King will answer and say to them, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it to one of these my brethren, <span class="add">even</span> these least, you did it to me. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Then will he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels: <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>for I was hungry, and you did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink; <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>I was a stranger, and you took me not in; naked, and you clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and you visited me not. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Then will they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we you hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you? <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Then will he answer them, saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it not to one of these least, you did it not to me. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And these will go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
