And he was speechless. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For many are called, but few chosen.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in <span class="add">his</span> talk. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for you regardest not the person of men. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Tell us therefore, What thinkest you? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make you trial of me, you hypocrites? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a denarius. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Whose is this image and superscription? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>They say to him, Cæsar’s. Then saith he to them, Render therefore to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s; and to God the things that are God’s. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And when they heard it, they marvelled, and left him, and went away.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him, <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother will marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife to his brother; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>in like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And after them all, the woman died. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>In the resurrection therefore whose wife will she be of the seven? for they all had her. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered and said to them, You do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not <span class="add">the God</span> of the dead, but of the living. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, trying him: <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law? <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>This is the great and first commandment. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And a second like <span class="add">to it</span> is this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>On these two commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>saying, What think you of the Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, <span class="add">The son</span> of David. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>He saith to them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>The Lord said to my Lord,</div><div class="q" >Sit you on my right hand,</div><div class="q" >Till I put thine enemies underneath your feet?</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son? <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And no one was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
