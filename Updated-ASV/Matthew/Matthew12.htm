And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, What man will there be of you, that will have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Jesus perceiving <span class="add">it</span> withdrew from there: and many followed him; and he healed them all, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>and charged them that they should not make him known: <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;</div><div class="q" >My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:</div><div class="q" >I will put my Spirit upon him,</div><div class="q" >And he will declare judgment to the Gentiles.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>He will not strive, nor cry aloud;</div><div class="q" >Neither will any one hear his voice in the streets.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>A bruised reed will he not break,</div><div class="q" >And smoking flax will he not quench,</div><div class="q" >Till he send forth judgment to victory.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And in his name will the Gentiles hope.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Then was brought to him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spoke and saw. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And knowing their thoughts he said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself will not stand: <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore will they be your judges. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Or how can one enter into the house of the strong <span class="add">man,</span> and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong <span class="add">man</span>?

for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil things. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And I say to you, that every idle word that men will speak, they will give account thereof in the day of judgment. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from you. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there will no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet: <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.
