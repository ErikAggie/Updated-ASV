A city set on a hill cannot be hid. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Neither do <span class="add">men</span> light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth to all that are in the house. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Even so let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will in no wise pass away from the law, until all things be accomplished. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Whosoever therefore will break one of these least commandments, and will teach men so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever will do and teach them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For I say to you, that except your righteousness will exceed <span class="add">the righteousness</span> of the scribes and Pharisees, you will in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>You have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shall not kill; and whosoever will kill will be in danger of the judgment: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>but I say to you, that every one who is angry with his brother will be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever will say to his brother, Raca, will be in danger of the council; and whosoever will say, Thou fool, will be in danger of the hell of fire. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>If therefore you art offering your gift at the altar, and there rememberest that your brother hath aught against you, <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Agree with thine adversary quickly, while you art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Verily I say to you, Thou shall by no means come out thence, until you have paid the last farthing.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>You have heard that it was said, Thou shall not commit adultery: <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>but I say to you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And if your right eye causeth you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not your whole body be cast into hell. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And if your right hand causeth you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not your whole body go into hell. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>It was said also, Whosoever will put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>but I say to you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever will marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Again, you have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shall not forswear thyself, but shall perform to the Lord thine oaths: <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>but I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Neither shall you swear by your head, for you canst not make one hair white or black. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil <span class="add">one</span>.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>but I say to you, Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And if any man would go to law with you, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And whosoever will compel you to go one mile, go with him two. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Give to him that asketh you, and from him that would borrow of you turn not you away.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>You have heard that it was said, Thou shall love your neighbor, and hate thine enemy: <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>but I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you; <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>For if you love them that love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same? <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more <span class="add">than others? </span> do not even the Gentiles the same? <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>You therefore will be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
