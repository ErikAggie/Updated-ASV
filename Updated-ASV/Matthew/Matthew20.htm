And they went their way. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And about the eleventh <span class="add">hour</span> he went out, and found others standing; and he saith to them, Why stand you here all the day idle? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>They say to him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them, Go you also into the vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their hire, beginning from the last to the first. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And when they came that <span class="add">were hired</span> about the eleventh hour, they received every man a shilling. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a shilling. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And when they received it, they murmured against the householder, <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>saying, These last have spent <span class="add">but</span> one hour, and you hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I do you no wrong: didst not you agree with me for a shilling? <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Take up that which is your, and go your way; it is my will to give to this last, even as to you. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? or is your eye evil, because I am good? <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>So the last will be first, and the first last.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said to them, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes; and they will condemn him to death, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he will be raised up.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping <span class="add">him</span>, and asking a certain thing of him. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he said to her, What wouldest you? She saith to him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your kingdom. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say to him, We are able. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>He saith to them, My cup indeed you will drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on <span class="add">my</span> left hand, is not mine to give; but <span class="add">it is for them</span> for whom it hath been prepared of my Father. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But Jesus called them to him, and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Not so will it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you will be your minister; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and whosoever would be first among you will be your servant: <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, son of David. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, son of David. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will you that I should do to you? <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and straightway they received their sight, and followed him.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
