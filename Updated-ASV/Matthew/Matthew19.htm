What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement, and to put <span class="add">her</span> away? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>He saith to them, Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it hath not been so. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And I say to you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her when she is put away commits adultery. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The disciples say to him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, Not all men can receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For there are eunuchs, that were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are eunuchs, that were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then were there brought to him little children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come to me: for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he laid his hands on them, and departed there.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And behold, one came to him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Why askest you me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if you wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>He saith to him, Which? And Jesus said, You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Honor your father and your mother; and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The young man saith to him, All these things have I observed: what lack I yet? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, If you wouldest be perfect, go, sell that which you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowful; for he was one that had great possessions.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to his disciples, Verily I say to you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when the disciples heard it, they were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Jesus looking upon <span class="add">them</span> said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Then answered Peter and said to him, Lo, we have left all, and followed you; what then shall we have? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, Verily I say to you, that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And every one that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>But many shall be last <span class="add">that are</span> first; and first <span class="add">that are</span> last.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
