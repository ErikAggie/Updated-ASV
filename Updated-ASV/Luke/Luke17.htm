And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God; <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Arise, and go your way: your faith hath made you whole.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>neither will they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you will not see it. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they will say to you, Lo, there!
