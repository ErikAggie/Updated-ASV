And he took him, and healed him, and let him go. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Which of you will have an ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And they could not answer again to these things.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he spake a parable to those that were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying to them, <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>When you are bidden of any man to a marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man than you be bidden of him, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>and he that bade you and him will come and say to you, Give this man place; and then you shall begin with shame to take the lowest place. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But when you are bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden you cometh, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher: then shall you have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with you. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For every one that exalteth himself will be humbled; and he that humbleth himself will be exalted.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he said to him also that had bidden him, When you makest a dinner or a supper, call not your friends, nor your brethren, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid you again, and a recompense be made you. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But when you makest a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and you shall be blessed; because they have not <span class="add">with what </span> to recompense you: for you shall be recompensed in the resurrection of the just.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he that will eat bread in the kingdom of God. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But he said to him, A certain man made a great supper; and he bade many: <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>and he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for <span class="add">all</span> things are now ready. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And they all with one <span class="add">consent</span> began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must needs go out and see it; I pray you have me excused. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray you have me excused. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the servant said, Lord, what you didst command is done, and yet there is room. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain <span class="add">them</span> to come in, that my house may be filled. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For I say to you, that none of those men that were bidden will taste of my supper.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said to them, <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>If any man cometh to me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Whosoever doth not bear his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost, whether he have <span class="add">wherewith</span> to complete it? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Lest haply, when he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him, <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Or what king, as he goeth to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and asketh conditions of peace. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>So therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Salt therefore is good: but if even the salt has lost its savor, with what will it be seasoned? <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill: <span class="add">men </span> cast it out.
