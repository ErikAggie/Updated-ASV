And he did eat nothing in those days: and when they were completed, he hungered. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the devil said to him, If you are the Son of God, command this stone that it become bread. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered to him, It is written, Man will not live by bread alone. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he led him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the devil said to him, To you will I give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it hath been delivered to me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>If you therefore wilt worship before me, it will all be your. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered and said to him, It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from hence: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>for it is written,</div><div class="q" >He will give his angels charge concerning you, to guard you:</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>and,</div><div class="q" >On their hands they will bear you up,</div><div class="q" >Lest haply you dash your foot against a stone.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answering said to him, It is said, You shall not make trial of the Lord your God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him for a season.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</div><div class="q" >Because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor:</div><div class="q" >He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives,</div><div class="q" >And recovering of sight to the blind,</div><div class="q" >To set at liberty them that are bruised,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he began to say to them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Is not this Joseph’s son? <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Doubtless you will say to me this parable, Physician, heal yourself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your own country. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he said, Verily I say to you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But of a truth I say to you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and to none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things; <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>But he passing through the midst of them went his way.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day: <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And in the synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? art you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And amazement came upon all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, What is this word? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon’s wife’s mother was held by a great fever; and they besought him for her. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered to them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, You art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came to him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, I must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
