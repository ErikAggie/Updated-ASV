<span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Behold, when you are entered into the city, there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And you will say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith to you, Where is the guest-chamber, where I will eat the passover with my disciples? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And they went, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>for I say to you, I will not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>for I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God will come. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the cup in like manner after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, <span class="add">even</span> that which is poured out for you. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For the Son of man indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed! <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And there arose also a contention among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But you <span class="add">will</span> not <span class="add">be</span> so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For which is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But you are they that have continued with me in my temptations; <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>and I appoint to you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed to me, <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat: <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>but I made supplication for you, that your faith fail not; and do you, when once you hast turned again, establish your brethren. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Lord, with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And he said, I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you shall thrice deny that you knowest me.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked you anything? And they said, Nothing. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For I say to you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And he came out, and went, as his custom was, to the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that you enter not into temptation. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And he was parted from them about a stone’s cast; and he kneeled down and prayed, <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>saying, Father, if you be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>And when he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow, <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>and said to them, Why sleep you? rise and pray, that you enter not into temptation.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near to Jesus to kiss him. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest you the Son of man with a kiss? <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, will we smite with the sword? <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered and said, Suffer you <span class="add">them</span> thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are you come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves? <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And they seized him, and led him <span class="add">away</span>, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed afar off. <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them. <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light <span class="add">of the fire</span>, and looking stedfastly upon him, said, This man also was with him. <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not. <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art <span class="add">one</span> of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not. <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilæan. <span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, Man, I know not what you sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. <span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said to him, Before the cock crow this day you shall deny me thrice. <span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>And he went out, and wept bitterly.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>And the men that held <span class="add">Jesus</span> mocked him, and beat him. <span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck you? <span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span>And many other things spake they against him, reviling him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span>And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying, <span class="verse" id="V67">67&nbsp;</span>If you art the Christ, tell us. But he said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe: <span class="verse" id="V68">68&nbsp;</span>and if I ask <span class="add">you</span>, you will not answer. <span class="verse" id="V69">69&nbsp;</span>But from henceforth will the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God. <span class="verse" id="V70">70&nbsp;</span>And they all said, Art you then the Son of God? And he said to them, You say that I am. <span class="verse" id="V71">71&nbsp;</span>And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
