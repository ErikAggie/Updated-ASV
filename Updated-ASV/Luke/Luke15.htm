And he divided to them his living. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave to him. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my fatherâ€™s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger! <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight: <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>I am no more worthy to be called your son: make me as one of your hired servants. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight: I am no more worthy to be called your son. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But the father said to his servants, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and bring the fatted calf, <span class="add">and</span> kill it, and let us eat, and make merry: <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he called to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Your brother is come; and your father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve you, and I never transgressed a commandment of your; and <span class="add">yet </span> you never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>but when this your son came, who hath devoured your living with harlots, you killedst for him the fatted calf. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Son, you are ever with me, and all that is mine is your. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this your brother was dead, and is alive <span class="add">again</span>; and <span class="add">was</span> lost, and is found.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
