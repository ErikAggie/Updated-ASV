<span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>to enrol himself with Mary, who was betrothed to him, being great with child. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the angel said to them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all the people: <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>for there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And this <span class="add">is</span> the sign to you: Ye will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Glory to God in the highest,</div><div class="q" >And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken to them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called JESUS, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb will be called holy to the Lord), <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law, <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Now lettest you your servant depart, Lord,</div><div class="q" >According to your word, in peace;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For mine eyes have seen your salvation,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Which you hast prepared before the face of all peoples;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>A light for revelation to the Gentiles,</div><div class="q" >And the glory of your people Israel.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him; <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this <span class="add">child</span> is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against; <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>yea and a sword will pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>and she had been a widow even to fourscore and four years), who departed not from the temple, worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast; <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not; <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance: <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>and when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions: <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, Son, why hast you thus dealt with us? behold, your father and I sought you sorrowing. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, How is it that you sought me? knew you not that I must be in my Father’s house? <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And they understood not the saying which he spake to them. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject to them: and his mother kept all <span class="add">these</span> sayings in her heart.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
