Fear not: you are of more value than many sparrows. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And I say to you, Every one who will confess me before men, him will the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>but he that denieth me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And every one who will speak a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it will not be forgiven. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And one out of the multitude said to him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he spake a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>and he reasoned within himself, saying, What will I do, because I have not where to bestow my fruits? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And I will say to my soul, Soul, you hast much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But God said to him, You foolish one, this night is your soul required of you; and the things which you hast prepared, whose will they be? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for <span class="add">your</span> life, what you will eat; nor yet for your body, what you will put on. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For the life is more than the food, and the body than the raiment. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feedeth them: of how much more value are you than the birds! <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to the measure of his life? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>If then you are not able to do even that which is least, why are you anxious concerning the rest? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Consider the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say to you, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more <span class="add">will he clothe </span> you, O you of little faith? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And seek not you what you will eat, and what you will drink, neither be you of doubtful mind. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: but your Father knows that you have need of these things. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Yet seek you his kingdom, and these things will be added to you. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Sell that which you have, and give alms; make for yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth near, neither moth destroyeth. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning; <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>and be you yourselves like to men looking for their lord, when he will return from the marriage feast; that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may straightway open to him. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh will find watching: verily I say to you, that he will gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and will come and serve them. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And if he will come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find <span class="add">them</span> so, blessed are those <span class="add">servants</span>. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not have left his house to be broken through. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Be you also ready: for in an hour that you think not the Son of man cometh.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And Peter said, Lord, speakest you this parable to us, or even to all? <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season? <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh will find so doing. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Of a truth I say to you, that he will set him over all that he hath. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>But if that servant will say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and will begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>the lord of that servant will come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, and will cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And that servant, who knew his lord’s will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, will be beaten with many <span class="add">stripes</span>; <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few <span class="add">stripes</span>. And to whomsoever much is given, of him will much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>I came to cast fire upon the earth; and what do I desire, if it is already kindled? <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished! <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Think you that I am come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>for there will be from henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And he said to the multitudes also, When you see a cloud rising in the west, straightway you say, There cometh a shower; and so it cometh to pass. <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>And when <span class="add">you see</span> a south wind blowing, you say, There will be a scorching heat; and it cometh to pass. <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>You hypocrites, you know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven; but how is it that you know not how to interpret this time? <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>And why even of yourselves judge you not what is right? <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>For as you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, on the way give diligence to be quit of him; lest haply he drag you to the judge, and the judge will deliver you to the officer, and the officer will cast you into prison. <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>I say to you, You shall by no means come out of there, till you have paid the very last mite.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
