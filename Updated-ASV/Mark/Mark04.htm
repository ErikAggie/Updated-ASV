And there is gathered to him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching, <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow: <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>and it came to pass, as he sowed, some <span class="add">seed</span> fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And other fell on the rocky <span class="add">ground</span>, where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things are done in parables: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Know you not this parable? and how shall you know all the parables? <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The sower soweth the word. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky <span class="add">places</span>, who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy; <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, <span class="add">and</span> not to be put on the stand? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was <span class="add">anything</span> made secret, but that it should come to light. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Take heed what you hear: with what measure you mete it shall be measured to you; and more shall be given to you. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth, <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And with many such parables spoke he the word to them, as they were able to hear it; <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>and without a parable spoke he not to them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And on that day, when even was come, he saith to them, Let us go over to the other side. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say to him, Teacher, carest you not that we perish? <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Why are you fearful? have you not yet faith? <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
