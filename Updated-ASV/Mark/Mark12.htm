A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a pit for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And again he sent to them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last to them, saying, They will reverence my son. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Have you not read even this scripture:</div><div class="q" >The stone which the builders rejected,</div><div class="q" >The same was made the head of the corner;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>This was from the Lord,</div><div class="q" >And it is marvellous in our eyes?</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spake the parable against them: and they left him, and went away.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And when they were come, they say to him, Teacher, we know that you are true, and carest not for any one; for you regardest not the person of men, but of a truth teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Shall we give, or will we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why make you trial of me? bring me a denarius, that I may see it. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And they brought it. And he said to them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said to him, Cæsar’s. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled greatly at him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And there come to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If a man’s brother die, and leave a wife behind him, and leave no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and the second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him; and the third likewise: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>In the resurrection whose wife will she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, Is it not for this cause that you err, that you know not the scriptures, nor the power of God? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But as touching the dead, that they are raised; have you not read in the book of Moses, in <span class="add">the place concerning</span> the Bush, how God spake to him, saying, I <span class="add">am</span> the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: you do greatly err.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one: <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>The second is this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is none other commandment greater than these. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And the scribe said to him, Of a truth, Teacher, you have well said that he is one; and there is none other but he: <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said to him, You art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered and said, as he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David? <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>David himself said in the Holy Spirit,</div><div class="q" >The Lord said to my Lord,</div><div class="q" >Sit you on my right hand,</div><div class="q" >Till I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>David himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and <span class="add">to have</span> salutations in the marketplaces, <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts: <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>they that devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And he sat down over against the treasury, and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And he called to him his disciples, and said to them, Verily I say to you, This poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury: <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>for they all did cast in of their superfluity; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, <span class="add">even</span> all her living.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
