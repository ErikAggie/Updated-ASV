And they said, Seven. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say to you, There will no sign be given to this generation. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he left them, and again entering into <span class="add">the boat</span> departed to the other side.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus perceiving it saith to them, Why reason you, because you have no bread? do you not yout perceive, neither understand? have you your heart hardened? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Having eyous, see you not? and having ears, hear you not? and do you not remember? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces took you up? They say to him, Twelve. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And when the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces took you up? And they say to him, Seven. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Do you not yout understand?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And they come to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest you aught? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I behold <span class="add">them </span> as trees, walking. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Cæsarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And they told him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And he asked them, But who say you that I am? Peter answereth and said to him, You art the Christ. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And he spake the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get you behind me, Satan; for you mindest not the things of God, but the things of men. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>For whosoever would save his life will lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>For what doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For what should a man give in exchange for his life? <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>For whosoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man also will be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
