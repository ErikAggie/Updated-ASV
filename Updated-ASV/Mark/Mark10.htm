But Jesus answereth again, and saith to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And they were astonished exceedingly, saying to him, Then who can be saved? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Peter began to say to him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed you. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, Verily I say to you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel’s sake, <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>but he will receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>But many <span class="add">that are</span> first will be last; and the last first.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen to him, <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">saying</span>, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles: <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>and they will mock him, and will spit upon him, and will scourge him, and will kill him; and after three days he will rise again.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And there come near to him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying to him, Teacher, we would that you shouldest do for us whatsoever we will ask of you. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, What would you that I should do for you? <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and one on <span class="add">your</span> left hand, in your glory. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to them, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal will you be baptized: <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>but to sit on my right hand or on <span class="add">my</span> left hand is not mine to give; but <span class="add">it is for them</span> for whom it hath been prepared. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And Jesus called them to him, and saith to them, You know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>But it is not so among you: but whosoever would become great among you, will be your minister; <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>and whosoever would be first among you, will be servant of all. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>For the Son of man also came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timæus, Bartimæus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And Jesus stood still, and said, Call you him. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth you. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt you that I should do to you? And the blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith hath made you whole. And straightway he received his sight, and followed him in the way.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
