I adjure you by God, torment me not. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For he said to him, Come forth, you unclean spirit, out of the man. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he asked him, What is your name? And he said to him, My name is Legion; for we are many. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, <span class="add">in number</span> about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, <span class="add">even</span> him that had the legion: and they were afraid. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And they that saw it declared to them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he suffered him not, but saith to him, Go to your house to your friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for you, and <span class="add">how</span> he had mercy on you. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falleth at his feet, <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and beseecheth him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: <span class="add">I pray thee</span>, that you come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>having heard the things concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For she said, If I touch but his garments, I shall be made whole. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And straightway Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power <span class="add">proceeding </span> from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And his disciples said to him, You seest the multitude thronging you, and sayest you, Who touched me? <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your plague.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>While he yet spoke, they come from the ruler of the synagogueâ€™s <span class="add">house</span>, saying, Your daughter is dead: why troublest you the Teacher any further? <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And he suffered no man to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he beholdeth a tumult, and <span class="add">many</span> weeping and wailing greatly. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And when he was entered in, he saith to them, Why make you a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleeps. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him, and goeth in where the child was. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And taking the child by the hand, he saith to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say to you, Arise. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And straightway the damsel rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that <span class="add">something</span> should be given her to eat.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
