For out of Zion will go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem; <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war any more. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none will make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted; <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And you, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, to you will it come, yea, the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Now why dost you cry out aloud? Is there no king in you, is your counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shall you go forth out of the city, and shall dwell in the field, and shall come even to Babylon: there shall you be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem you from the hand of your enemies. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And now many nations are assembled against you, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see <span class="add">our desire</span> upon Zion. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs brass; and you shall beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain to Jehovah, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
