What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, <span class="add">and </span> as places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will uncover the foundations thereof. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And all her graven images will be beaten to pieces, and all her hires will be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them, and to the hire of a harlot will they return.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For this will I lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even to Judah; it reacheth to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at Beth-le-aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Pass away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come; the wailing of Beth-ezel will take from you the stay thereof. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good, because evil is come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in you. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore shall you give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>I will yet bring to you, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that will possess you: the glory of Israel will come even to Adullam. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Make you bald, and cut off your hair for the children of your delight: enlarge your baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from you.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
