And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the angel said to me, Wherefore didst you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The beast that you sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth will wonder, <span class="add">they</span> whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and will come. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>and they are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes into perdition. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the ten horns that you sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they <span class="add">also will overcome </span> that are with him, called and chosen and faithful. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he saith to me, The waters which you sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the ten horns which you sawest, and the beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the woman whom you sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
