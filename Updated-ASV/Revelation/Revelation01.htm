And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks; <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>and in the midst of the candlesticks one like to a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And his head and his hair were white as white wool, <span class="add">white </span> as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>and his feet like to burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Write therefore the things which you sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>the mystery of the seven stars which you sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
