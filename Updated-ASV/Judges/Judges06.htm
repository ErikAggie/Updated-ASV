But you have not hearkened to my voice.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the angel of Jehovah came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the angel of Jehovah appeared to him, and said to him, Jehovah is with you, you mighty man of valor. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Gideon said to him, Oh, my lord, if Jehovah is with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt? but now Jehovah hath cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah looked upon him, and said, Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian: have not I sent you? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Oh, Lord, with what will I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall smite the Midianites as one man. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you that talkest with me. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Depart not hence, I pray you, until I come to you, and bring forth my present, and lay it before you. And he said, I will tarry until you come again.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Gideon saw that he was the angel of Jehovah; and Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of Jehovah face to face. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to him, Peace be to you; fear not: you shall not die. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then Gideon built an altar there to Jehovah, and called it Jehovah-shalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Take your father’s bullock, even the second bullock seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and build an altar to Jehovah your God upon the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Jehovah had spoken to him: and it came to pass, because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? he that will contend for him, let him be put to death whilst <span class="add">it is yet</span> morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath broken down his altar. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he hath broken down his altar.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you hast spoken, <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then will I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you hast spoken. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And it was so; for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And Gideon said to God, Let not your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray you, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
