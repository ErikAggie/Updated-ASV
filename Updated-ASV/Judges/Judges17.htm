And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And he restored the eleven hundred <span class="add">pieces</span> of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred <span class="add">pieces</span> of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find <span class="add">a place</span>, and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou?
