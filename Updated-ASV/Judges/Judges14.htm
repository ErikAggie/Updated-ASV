And Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But his father and his mother knew not that it was of Jehovah; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid; and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And his father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you: if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment; <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>but if you cannot declare it to me, then shall you give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said to him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he said to them,</div><div class="q" >Out of the eater came forth food,</div><div class="q" >And out of the strong came forth sweetness.</div><div class="p" >And they could not in three days declare the riddle.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson’s wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father’s house with fire: have you called us to impoverish us? is it not <span class="add">so</span>? <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, You dost but hate me, and lovest me not: you have put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and have not told it me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them,</div><div class="q" >If you had not plowed with my heifer,</div><div class="q" >You had not found out my riddle.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes <span class="add">of raiment</span> to them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But Samson’s wife was <span class="add">given</span> to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
