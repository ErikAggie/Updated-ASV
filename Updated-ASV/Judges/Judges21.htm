For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to Jehovah to Mizpah, saying, He will surely be put to death. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>How will we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Jehovah to Mizpah?
