and whence comest you? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah to the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from there am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am <span class="add">now</span> going to the house of Jehovah; and there is no man that taketh me into his house. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man that is with your servants: there is no want of anything. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the old man said, Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seemeth good to you: but to this man do not any such folly. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But the men would not hearken to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord was, till it was light.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he said to her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and gat him to his place. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
