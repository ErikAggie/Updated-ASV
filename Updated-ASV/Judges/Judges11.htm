And in like manner he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray you, through your land to my place. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>So now Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Wilt not you possess that which Chemosh your god giveth you to possess? So whomsoever Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And now art you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did you not recover them within that time? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And Jephthah vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>then it will be, that whatsoever comes from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it will be Jehovah’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Jehovah delivered them into his hand. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And he smote them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I cannot go back. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And she said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to Jehovah; do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of your mouth, forasmuch as Jehovah hath taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew not man. And it was a custom in Israel, <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
