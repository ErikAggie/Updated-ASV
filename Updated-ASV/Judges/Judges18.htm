And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside there, and said to him, Who brought you hither? and what doest you in this place? and what hast you here? <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go will be prosperous. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before Jehovah is your way wherein you go.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put <span class="add">them</span> to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they came to their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said to them, What <span class="add">say</span> you? <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are you still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>When you go, you will come to a people secure, and the land is large; for God hath given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And there set forth from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan, to this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And they passed there to the hill-country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said to their brethren, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And they turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And when these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, What do you? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand upon your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What aileth you, that you comest with such a company? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he said, you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say you to me, What aileth you? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And the children of Dan said to him, Let not your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>So they set them up Micah’s graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
