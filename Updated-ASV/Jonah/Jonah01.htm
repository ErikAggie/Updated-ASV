But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, What meanest you, O sleeper? arise, call upon your God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then said they to him, Tell us, we pray you, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is your occupation? and whence comest you? what is your country? and of what people art you? <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, What is this that you have done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then said they to him, What will we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so will the sea be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Wherefore they cried to Jehovah, and said, We beseech you, O Jehovah, we beseech you, let us not perish for this manâ€™s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for you, O Jehovah, have done as it pleased you. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice to Jehovah, and made vows.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
