your builders have perfected your beauty. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>They have made all your planks of fir-trees from Senir; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars; they have made your benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was your sail, that it might be to you for an ensign; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was your awning. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers: your wise men, O Tyre, were in you, they were your pilots. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The old men of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to deal in your merchandise. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Persia and Lud and Put were in your army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in you;
