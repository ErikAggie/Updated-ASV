Surely, if I sent you to them, they would hearken to you. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But the house of Israel will not hearken to you; for they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And go, get you to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, <span class="add">saying</span>, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And <span class="add">I heard</span> the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Again, when a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself within your house. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But you, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them: <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
