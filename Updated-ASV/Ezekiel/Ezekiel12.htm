<span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Say you to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden <span class="add">concerneth </span> the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so will it be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the prince that is among them will bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and will go forth: they will dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he will cover his face, because he will not see the land with his eyes. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>My net also will I spread upon him, and he will be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet will he not see it, though he will die there. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And they will know that I am Jehovah, when I will disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they will know that I am Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and say to the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, <span class="add">and despoiled</span> of all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the cities that are inhabited will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation; and you will know that I am Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they will no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For there will be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For I am Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I will speak will be performed; it will be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There will none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I will speak will be performed, saith the Lord Jehovah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
