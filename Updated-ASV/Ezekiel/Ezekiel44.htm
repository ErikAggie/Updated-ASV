and it was shut. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to me, This gate will be shut; it will not be opened, neither will any man enter in by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it will be shut. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>As for the prince, he will sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he will enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and will go out by the way of the same.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every egress of the sanctuary. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And you shall say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O you house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, <span class="add">to add</span> to all your abominations. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And you have not kept the charge of my holy things; but you have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, will enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they will bear their iniquity. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Yet they will be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they will slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they will stand before them to minister to them. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity to the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they will bear their iniquity. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And they will not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that will be done therein.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they will come near to me to minister to me; and they will stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah: <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>they will enter into my sanctuary, and they will come near to my table, to minister to me, and they will keep my charge. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And it will be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they will be clothed with linen garments; and no wool will come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>They will have linen tires upon their heads, and will have linen breeches upon their loins; they will not gird themselves with <span class="add">anything that causeth</span> sweat. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they will put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they will put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Neither will they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they will only cut off the hair of their heads. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Neither will any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Neither will they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they will take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they will teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And in a controversy they will stand to judge; according to mine ordinances will they judge it: and they will keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they will hallow my sabbaths. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And they will go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And after he is cleansed, they will reckon to him seven days. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he will offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And they will have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and you will give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>They will eat the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel will be theirs. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every oblation of everything, of all your oblations, will be for the priest: you will also give to the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on your house. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>The priests will not eat of anything that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
