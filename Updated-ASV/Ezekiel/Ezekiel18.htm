When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he will surely live. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The soul that sinneth, it will die: the son will not bear the iniquity of the father, neither will the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he will surely live, he will not die. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>None of his transgressions that he hath committed will be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he hath done he will live. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Jehovah; and not rather that he should return from his way, and live? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, will he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done will be remembered: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them will he die.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal.

O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal? <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Return you, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity will not be your ruin. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherein you have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you die, O house of Israel? <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord Jehovah: wherefore turn yourselves, and live.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
