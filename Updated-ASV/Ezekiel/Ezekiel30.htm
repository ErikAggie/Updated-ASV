it will be a day of clouds, a time of the nations. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And a sword will come upon Egypt, and anguish will be in Ethiopia, when the slain will fall in Egypt; and they will take away her multitude, and her foundations will be broken down. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, will fall with them by the sword.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt will fall;
