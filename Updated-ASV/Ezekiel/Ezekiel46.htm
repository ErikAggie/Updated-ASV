but on the sabbath day it will be opened, and on the day of the new moon it will be opened. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the prince will enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and will stand by the post of the gate; and the priests will prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he will worship at the threshold of the gate: then he will go forth; but the gate will not be shut until the evening. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the people of the land will worship at the door of that gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the burnt-offering that the prince will offer to Jehovah will be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>and the meal-offering will be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And on the day of the new moon it will be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they will be without blemish: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and he will prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And when the prince will enter, he will go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he will go forth by the way thereof.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But when the people of the land will come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship will go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate will go forth by the way of the north gate: he will not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but will go forth straight before him. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the prince, when they go in, will go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they will go forth <span class="add">together</span>. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering will be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And when the prince will prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering to Jehovah, one will open for him the gate that looketh toward the east; and he will prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he doth on the sabbath day: then he will go forth; and after his going forth one will shut the gate.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And you shall prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering to Jehovah daily: morning by morning shall you prepare it. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And you shall prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal-offering to Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Thus will they prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it will belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it will be his to the year of liberty; then it will return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it will be for his sons. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Moreover the prince will not take of the peopleâ€™s inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he will give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, This is the place where the priests will boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, <span class="add">and</span> where they will bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed, forty <span class="add">cubits</span> long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then said he to me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house will boil the sacrifice of the people.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
