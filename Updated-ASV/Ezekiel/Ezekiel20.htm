As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Wilt you judge them, son of man, wilt you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers; <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and sware to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I sware to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>in that day I sware to them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And I said to them, Cast you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken to me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And I gave them my statutes, and showed them mine ordinances, which if a man do, he will live in them. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth them. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man keep, he will live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Moreover also I sware to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless mine eye spared them, and I destroyed them not, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>I am Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>and hallow my sabbaths; and they will be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am Jehovah your God. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he will live in them; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Moreover I sware to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>because they had not executed mine ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through <span class="add">the fire</span> all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For when I had brought them into the land, which I sware to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink-offerings. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Then I said to them, What meaneth the high place whereunto you go? So the name thereof is called Bamah to this day. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Wherefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Do you pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers? and play you the harlot after their abominations? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>and when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons to pass through the fire, do you pollute yourselves with all your idols to this day? and will I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you; <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>and that which cometh into your mind will not be at all, in that you say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, will I be king over you: <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out; <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, saith the Lord Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant; <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they will not enter into the land of Israel: and you will know that I am Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go you, serve every one his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not hearken to me; but my holy name will you no more profane with your gifts, and with your idols.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, there will all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>As a sweet savor will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And you will know that I am Jehovah, when I will bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I sware to give to your fathers. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And there will you remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein you have polluted yourselves; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And you will know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O you house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span> <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Ch. 21:1 in Heb.</span></a>And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop <span class="add">your word </span> toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South; <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>and say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it will devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame will not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north will be burnt thereby. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And all flesh will see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it will not be quenched. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! they say of me, Is he not a speaker of parables?</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
