Were your whoredoms a small matter, <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>that you hast slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through <span class="add">the fire</span> to them? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And in all thine abominations and your whoredoms you hast not remembered the days of your youth, when you wast naked and bare, and wast weltering in your blood.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And it is come to pass after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! saith the Lord Jehovah), <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>that you hast built to you a vaulted place, and hast made you a lofty place in every street. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>You hast built your lofty place at the head of every way, and hast made your beauty an abomination, and hast opened your feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied your whoredom. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>You hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied your whoredom, to provoke me to anger. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished thine ordinary <span class="add">food</span>, and delivered you to the will of them that hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of your lewd way. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>You hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because you wast insatiable; yea, you hast played the harlot with them, and yet you wast not satisfied. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>You hast moreover multiplied your whoredom to the land of traffic, to Chaldea; and yet you wast not satisfied herewith.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>How weak is your heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing you doest all these things, the work of an impudent harlot; <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>in that you buildest your vaulted place at the head of every way, and makest your lofty place in every street, and hast not been as a harlot, in that you scornest hire. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>A wife that committeth adultery! that taketh strangers instead of her husband! <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>They give gifts to all harlots; but you givest your gifts to all your lovers, and bribest them, that they may come to you on every side for your whoredoms. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And you are different from <span class="add">other</span> women in your whoredoms, in that none followeth you to play the harlot; and whereas you givest hire, and no hire is given to you, therefore you are different.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah: <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your whoredoms with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations, and for the blood of your children, that you didst give to them; <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>therefore behold, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you hast taken pleasure, and all them that you hast loved, with all them that you hast hated; I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And I will judge you, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places; and they will strip you of your clothes, and take your fair jewels; and they will leave you naked and bare. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>They will also bring up a company against you, and they will stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And they will burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women; and I will cause you to cease from playing the harlot, and you shall also give no hire any more. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>So will I cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy will depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Because you hast not remembered the days of your youth, but hast raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring your way upon your head, saith the Lord Jehovah: and you shall not commit this lewdness with all thine abominations.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Behold, every one that useth proverbs will use <span class="add">this</span> proverb against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>You art the daughter of your mother, that loatheth her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, that dwelleth at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Yet hast you not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as <span class="add">if that were</span> a very little <span class="add">thing</span>, you wast more corrupt than they in all your ways. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom your sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as you hast done, you and your daughters. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw <span class="add">good</span>. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Neither hath Samaria committed half of your sins; but you hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified your sisters by all thine abominations which you hast done. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>You also, bear you thine own shame, in that you hast given judgment for your sisters; through your sins that you hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than you: yea, be you also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you hast justified your sisters.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives in the midst of them; <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>that you mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that you hast done, in that you are a comfort to them. <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>And your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former estate; and you and your daughters will return to your former estate. <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride, <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite to you round about. <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>You hast borne your lewdness and thine abominations, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also deal with you as you hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant. <span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>Then shall you remember your ways, and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, thine elder <span class="add">sisters</span> and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant. <span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>And I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know that I am Jehovah; <span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>that you mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more, because of your shame, when I have forgiven you all that you hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
