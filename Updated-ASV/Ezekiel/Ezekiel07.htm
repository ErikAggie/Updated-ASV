and I will bring upon you all your abominations. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And mine eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways upon you, and your abominations will be in the midst of you: and you will know that I am Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>An end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against you; behold, it cometh. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Your doom is come to you, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near, <span class="add">a day of</span> tumult, and not <span class="add">of</span> joyful shouting, upon the mountains. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Now will I shortly pour out my wrath upon you, and accomplish mine anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring upon you all your abominations. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And mine eye will not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon you according to your ways; and your abominations will be in the midst of you; and you will know that I, Jehovah, do smite.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: your doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them <span class="add">will remain</span>, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither will there be eminency among them. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For the seller will not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none will return; neither will any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field will die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence will devour him. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But those of them that escape will escape, and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>They will also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them; and shame will be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they will not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations <span class="add">and</span> their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they will profane it. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>My face will I turn also from them, and they will profane my secret <span class="add">place</span>; and robbers will enter into it, and profane it.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places will be profaned. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Destruction cometh; and they will seek peace, and there will be none. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Mischief will come upon mischief, and rumor will be upon rumor; and they will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land will be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they will know that I am Jehovah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
