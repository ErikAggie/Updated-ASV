Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through <span class="add">the waters</span>, waters that were to the loins. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Afterward he measured a thousand; <span class="add">and it was</span> a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Son of man, hast you seen <span class="add">this</span>? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then said he to me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and will go down into the Arabah; and they will go toward the sea; into the sea <span class="add">will the waters go</span> which were made to issue forth; and the waters will be healed. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, will live; and there will be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come there, and <span class="add">the waters of the sea</span> will be healed, and everything will live whithersoever the river cometh. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, that fishers will stand by it: from En-gedi even to En-eglaim will be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish will be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, will not be healed; they will be given up to salt. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, will grow every tree for food, whose leaf will not whither, neither will the fruit thereof fail: it will bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof will be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This will be the border, whereby you will divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph <span class="add">will have two</span> portions. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And you will inherit it, one as well as another; for I sware to give it to your fathers: and this land will fall to you for inheritance.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And this will be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad; <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the border from the sea, will be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath.
