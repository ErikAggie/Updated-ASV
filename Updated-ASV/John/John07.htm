If you doest these things, manifest thyself to the world. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For even his brethren did not believe on him. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore saith to them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Go you up to the feast: I go not up to this feast; because my time is not yout fulfilled. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And having said these things to them, he abode <span class="add">still</span> in Galilee.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But when his brethren were gone up to the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>If any man willeth to do his will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or <span class="add">whether</span> I speak from myself. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Did not Moses give you the law, and <span class="add">yet</span> none of you doeth the law? Why seek you to kill me? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill you? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel because thereof. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath you circumcise a man. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ will come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done? <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go to him that sent me. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Ye will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, you cannot come. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we will not find him? will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>What is this word that he said, Ye will seek me, and will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Now on the last day, the great <span class="add">day</span> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him will flow rivers of living water. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet <span class="add">given</span>; because Jesus was not yet glorified. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">Some</span> of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee? <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>So there arose a division in the multitude because of him. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why did you not bring him? <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>The officers answered, Never man so spake. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are you also led astray? <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees? <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus saith to them (he that came to him before, being one of them), <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth? <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>They answered and said to him, Art you also of Galilee?
