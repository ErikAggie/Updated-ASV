Art you Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art you the prophet? And he answered, No. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, Who art you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest you of yourself? <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And they had been sent from the Pharisees. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And they asked him, and said to him, Why then baptizest you, if you are not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom you know not, <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">even</span> he that comes after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world! <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, Upon whomsoever you shall see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples; <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God! <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith to them, What seek you? And they said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abidest you? <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>He saith to them, Come, and you will see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>One of the two that heard John <span class="add">speak</span>, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peterâ€™s brother. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>He findeth first his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ). <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, You art Simon the son of John: you shall be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith to him, Follow me. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Philip findeth Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest you me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you wast under the fig tree, I saw you. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are King of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you underneath the fig tree, believest you? you shall see greater things than these. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And he saith to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, You will see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
