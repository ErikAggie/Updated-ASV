He saith to him, Lord, dost you wash my feet? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you knowest not now; but you shall understand hereafter. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Peter saith to him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, You are not all clean.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said to them, Know you what I have done to you? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>You call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and you say well; for so I am. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Verily, verily, I say to you, A servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am <span class="add">he</span>. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Verily, verily, I say to you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>There was at the table reclining in Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and said to him, Tell <span class="add">us</span> who it is of whom he speaketh. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus’ breast saith to him, Lord, who is it? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, <span class="add">the son</span> of Simon Iscariot. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith to him, What you do, do quickly. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>When therefore he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him; <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>and God shall glorify him in himself, and straightway shall he glorify him. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Whither I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, whither goest you? Jesus answered, Whither I go, you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow afterwards. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Peter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you even now? I will lay down my life for you. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>Jesus answereth, Wilt you lay down your life for me? Verily, verily, I say to you, The cock shall not crow, till you have denied me thrice.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
