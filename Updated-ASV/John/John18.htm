Jesus said to them, I am <span class="add">he</span>. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>When therefore he said to them, I am <span class="add">he</span>, they went backward, and fell to the ground. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek you? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, I told you that I am <span class="add">he</span>; if therefore you seek me, let these go their way: <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, Of those whom you have given me I lost not one. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchus. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him, <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and <span class="add">so did</span> another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The maid therefore that kept the door saith to Peter, Art you also <span class="add">one</span> of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Now the servants and the officers were standing <span class="add">there</span>, having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spoke I nothing. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Why askest you me? ask them that have heard <span class="add">me</span>, what I spoke to them: behold, these know the things which I said. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest you the high priest so? <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest you me? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Annas therefore sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, Art you also <span class="add">one</span> of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see you in the garden with him? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Prætorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the Prætorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Pilate therefore went out to them, and saith, What accusation bring you against this man? <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>They answered and said to him, If this man were not an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him up to you. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Pilate therefore said to them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what manner of death he should die.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Pilate therefore entered again into the Prætorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art you the King of the Jews? <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, Sayest you this of yourself, or did others tell it you concerning me? <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me: what have you done? <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Pilate therefore said to him, Art you a king then? Jesus answered, You sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>Pilate saith to him, What is truth?</div><div class="p" >And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them, I find no crime in him. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>But you have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover: will you therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews? <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain. This modification is Copyright 2019 by Erik Peterson.
