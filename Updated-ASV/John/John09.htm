He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am <span class="add">he</span>. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, How then were your eyes opened? <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>They say therefore to the blind man again, What sayest you of him, in that he opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? how then does he now see? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him <span class="add">to be </span> Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, What did he to you? how opened he your eyes? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>He answered them, I told you even now, and you did not hear; wherefore would you hear it again? would you also become his disciples? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And they reviled him, and said, You art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>We know that God hath spoken to Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>The man answered and said to them, Why, herein is the marvel, that you know not whence he is, and <span class="add">yet</span> he opened mine eyes. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>They answered and said to him, You wast altogether born in sins, and dost you teach us? And they cast him out.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost you believe on the Son of God? <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with you. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, Are we also blind? <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no sin: but now you say, We see: your sin remaineth.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
