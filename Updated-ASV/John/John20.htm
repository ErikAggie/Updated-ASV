She saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest you? whom seekest you? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith to him, Sir, if you hast borne him hence, tell me where you hast laid him, and I will take him away. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith to her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith to him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to the Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and <span class="add">that</span> he had said these things to her.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first <span class="add">day </span> of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, Peace <span class="add">be</span> to you. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And when he had said this, he showed to them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace <span class="add">be</span> to you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith to them, Receive you the Holy Spirit: <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>whose soever sins you forgive, they are forgiven to them; whose soever <span class="add">sins</span> you retain, they are retained.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord.
