He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Verily, verily, I say to you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Verily, verily, I say to you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear will live. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice, <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>and will come; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>You have sent to John, and he hath borne witness to the truth. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that you may be saved. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and you were willing to rejoice for a season in his light. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>But the witness which I have is greater than <span class="add">that of</span> John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him you believe not. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>You search the scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me; <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>and you will not come to me, that you may have life. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>I receive not glory from men. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>But I know you, that you have not the love of God in yourselves. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>I am come in my Father’s name, and you receive me not: if another will come in his own name, him you will receive. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>How can you believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that <span class="add">cometh</span> from the only God you seek not? <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, <span class="add">even</span> Moses, on whom you have set your hope. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>But if you believe not his writings, how will you believe my words?</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
