And these things I said not to you from the beginning, because I was with you. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But now I go to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest you? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>of sin, because they believe not on me; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you behold me no more; <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, <span class="add">these</span> shall he speak: and he shall declare to you the things that are to come. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare <span class="add">it</span> to you. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare <span class="add">it</span> to you. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>A little while, and you behold me no more; and again a little while, and you shall see me. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">Some</span> of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith to us, A little while, and you behold me not; and again a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and you behold me not, and again a little while, and you shall see me? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Verily, verily, I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And you therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And in that day you shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say to you, If you shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Hitherto have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>These things have I spoken to you in dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak to you in dark sayings, but shall tell you plainly of the Father. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>In that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>for the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>His disciples say, Lo, now speakest you plainly, and speakest no dark saying. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Now know we that you knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you camest forth from God. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and <span class="add">yet</span> I am not alone, because the Father is with me. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>These things have I spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
