But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, <span class="add">even</span> to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Jesus lifted up himself, and said to her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn you? <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you: go your way; from henceforth sin no more.]</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Again therefore Jesus spake to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bearest witness of yourself; your witness is not true. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but you know not whence I come, or whither I go. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>You judge after the flesh; I judge no man. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither me, nor my Father: if you knew me, you would know my Father also. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>He said therefore again to them, I go away, and you will seek me, and will die in your sin: whither I go, you cannot come. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, you cannot come? <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>I said therefore to you, that you will die in your sins: for except you believe that I am <span class="add">he</span>, you will die in your sins. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, Who art you? Jesus said to them, Even that which I have also spoken to you from the beginning. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I to the world. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then will you know that I am <span class="add">he</span>, and <span class="add">that</span> I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>As he spake these things, many believed on him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If you abide in my word, <span class="add">then</span> are you truly my disciples; <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>They answered to him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest you, You will be made free? <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>If therefore the Son will make you free, you will be free indeed. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>I know that you are Abraham’s seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>I speak the things which I have seen with <span class="add">my</span> Father: and you also do the things which you heard from <span class="add">your</span> father. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>They answered and said to him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith to them, If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>But now you seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>You do the works of your father. They said to him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, <span class="add">even</span> God. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Why do you not understand my speech? <span class="add">Even</span> because you cannot hear my word. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>You are of <span class="add">your</span> father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>But because I say the truth, you believe me not. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do you not believe me? <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause you hear <span class="add">them</span> not, because you are not of God. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>The Jews answered and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and hast a demon? <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Verily, verily, I say to you, If a man keep my word, he will never see death. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>The Jews said to him, Now we know that you hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you sayest, If a man keep my word, he will never taste of death. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>Art you greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest you yourself? <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom you say, that he is your God; <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>and you have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I will be like to you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word. <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad. <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore said to him, You art not yet fifty years old, and hast you seen Abraham? <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham was born, I am. <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
