They say to him, We also come with you. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore saith to them, Children, have you anything to eat? They answered him, No. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net <span class="add">full </span> of fishes. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fish which you have now taken. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith to them, Come <span class="add">and</span> break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art you? knowing that it was the Lord. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, <span class="add">son</span> of John, lovest you me more than these? He saith to him, Yea, Lord; you knowest that I love you. He saith to him, Feed my lambs. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>He saith to him again a second time, Simon, <span class="add">son</span> of John, lovest you me? He saith to him, Yea, Lord; you knowest that I love you. He saith to him, Tend my sheep. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He saith to him the third time, Simon, <span class="add">son</span> of John, lovest you me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Lovest you me? And he said to him, Lord, you knowest all things; you knowest that I love you. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Verily, verily, I say to you, When you wast young, you girdedst yourself, and walkedst whither you wouldest: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another will gird you, and carry you whither you wouldest not. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him, Follow me. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth you? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what will this man do? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <span class="add">is that</span> to you? follow you me. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <span class="add">is that</span> to you?</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
