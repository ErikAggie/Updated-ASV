Tell me, I pray you. Is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge in? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare to Nahor. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master: as for me, Jehovah hath led me in the way to the house of my master’s brethren.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And the damsel ran, and told her mother’s house according to these words. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the fountain. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man to me; that he came to the man; and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he said, Come in, you blessed of Jehovah; wherefore standest you without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand.

And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare to him: and I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah: we cannot speak to you bad or good. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Behold, Rebekah is before you, take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as Jehovah hath spoken. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master. <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us <span class="add">a few</span> days, at the least ten; after that she will go. <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth. <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt you go with this man? And she said, I will go. <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men. <span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Our sister, be you <span class="add">the mother</span> of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those that hate them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. <span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land of the South. <span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming. <span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel. <span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span>And she said to the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master: and she took her veil, and covered herself. <span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span>And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. <span class="verse" id="V67">67&nbsp;</span>And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her.
