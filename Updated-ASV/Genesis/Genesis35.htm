and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And God said to him, Your name is Jacob: your name will not be called any more Jacob, but Israel will be your name: and he called his name Israel. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations will be of you, and kings will come out of your loins; <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to you I will give it, and to your seed after you will I give the land. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And they journeyed from Beth-el;
