For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, <span class="add">said he</span>, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
