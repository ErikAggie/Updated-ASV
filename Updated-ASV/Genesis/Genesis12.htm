And the Canaanite was then in the land. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said, Unto your seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar to Jehovah, who appeared to him. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he removed from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar to Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he came near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that you are a fair woman to look upon: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see you, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save you alive. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Say, I pray you, you are my sister; that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that you have done to me? why didst you not tell me that she was your wife? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>why saidst you, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold your wife, take her, and go your way. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
