And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Rebekah spake to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Jehovah before my death. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loveth: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>and you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>My father peradventure will feel me, and I will seem to him as a deceiver; and I will bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And his mother said to him, Upon me be your curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go fetch me them. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son; <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>and she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art you, my son? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your first-born; I have done according as you badest me: arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah your God sent me good speed. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, whether you be my very son Esau or not. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he said, Art you my very son Esau?
