And Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spake roughly with them; and he said to them, Whence come you? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land you are come. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are your servants come. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, your servants are no spies. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land you are come. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And they said, We your servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Joseph said to them, That is it that I spake to you, saying, Ye are spies: <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>hereby you will be proved: by the life of Pharaoh you will not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and you will be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he put them all together into ward three days.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>if you be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go you, carry grain for the famine of your houses: <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>and bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you will not die. And they did so. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not to you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and you would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus was it done to them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he said to his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done to us? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying, <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies: <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Hereby will I know that you are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take <span class="add">grain for</span> the famine of your houses, and go your way; <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>and bring your youngest brother to me: then will I know that you are no spies, but that you are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and you will traffic in the land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And Jacob their father said to them, Me have you bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And Reuben spake to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to you: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you again. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And he said, My son will not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which you go, then will you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
