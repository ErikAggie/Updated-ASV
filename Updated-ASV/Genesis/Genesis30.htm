Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray you, of your son’s mandrakes. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? and wouldest you take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he will lie with you to-night for your son’s mandrakes. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach: <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>and she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another son.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to mine own place, and to my country. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go: for you knowest my service with what I have served you. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And Laban said to him, If now I have found favor in your eyes, <span class="add">tarry</span>: <span class="add">for</span> I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for your sake. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, You knowest how I have served you, and how your cattle have fared with me. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For it was little which you hadst before I came, and it hath increased to a multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed you wherever I turned: and now when will I provide for mine own house also? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he said, What will I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me anything: if you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>I will pass through all your flock to-day, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and <span class="add">of such</span> will be my hire. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>So will my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when you shall come concerning my hire that is before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that, <span class="add">if found </span> with me, will be counted stolen. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to your word. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons; <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>and he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not to Laban’s flock. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods; <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
