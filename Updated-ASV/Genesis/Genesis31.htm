Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Laban said to Jacob, What hast you done, that you hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Wherefore didst you flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp; <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast you done foolishly. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake to me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And now, <span class="add">though</span> you wouldest needs be gone, because you sore longedst after your father’s house, <span class="add">yet</span> wherefore hast you stolen my gods? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest you shouldest take your daughters from me by force. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>With whomsoever you findest your gods, he will not live: before our brethren discern you what is thine with me, and take it to you. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before you; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that you hast hotly pursued after me? <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Whereas you hast felt about all my stuff, what hast you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>These twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of your flocks have I not eaten. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>That which was torn of beasts I brought not to you; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst you require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>These twenty years have I been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock: and you hast changed my wages ten times. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst you sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you yesternight.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you seest is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne? <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And now come, let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be for a witness between me and you. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and you this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed: <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>If you shall afflict my daughters, and if you shall take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and you. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and you. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac. <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain. <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
