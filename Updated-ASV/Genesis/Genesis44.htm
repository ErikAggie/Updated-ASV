And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">And</span> when they were gone out of the city, and were not yout far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when you dost overtake them, say to them, Wherefore have you rewarded evil for good? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? you have done evil in so doing. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he overtook them, and he spake to them these words. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of your lord’s house silver or gold? <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>With whomsoever of your servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my bondman; and you will be blameless. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he searched, <span class="add">and</span> began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? know you not that such a man as I can indeed divine? <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Judah said, What will we say to my lord? what will we speak? or how will we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of your servants: behold, we are my lord’s bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace to your father.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh, my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against your servant; for you art even as Pharaoh. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father, or a brother? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And you saidst to your servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And you saidst to your servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, you will see my face no more. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And your servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>and if you take this one also from me, and harm befall him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life; <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not <span class="add">with us</span>, that he will die: and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to you, then will I bear the blame to my father for ever. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, let your servant, I pray you, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>For how will I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that will come on my father.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
