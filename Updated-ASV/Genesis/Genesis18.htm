And they said, So do, as you hast said. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it to the servant; and he hasted to dress it. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he said, I will certainly return to you when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah your wife will have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, <span class="add">and</span> well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old? <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return to you, when the season cometh round, and Sarah will have a son. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but you didst laugh.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do; <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>seeing that Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt you consume the righteous with the wicked? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from you: will not the Judge of all the earth do right? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes: <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt you destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And he spake to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty’s sake. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there will thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord: peradventure there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
