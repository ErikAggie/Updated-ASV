And he said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face: and, lo, God hath let me see your seed also. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long to this day, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put your right hand upon his head. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And his father refused, and said, I know <span class="add">it</span>, my son, I know <span class="add">it</span>; he also will become a people, and he also will be great: howbeit his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he blessed them that day, saying, In you will Israel bless, saying, God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
