And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect to Abel and to his offering: <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>but to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Cain, Why art you wroth? and why is your countenance fallen? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>If you do well, will it not be lifted up? and if you do not well, sin coucheth at the door: and to you will be its desire; but do you rule over it. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother’s blood crieth to me from the ground. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And now cursed art you from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand; <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>when you tillest the ground, it will not henceforth yield to you its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shall you be in the earth. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from your face will I be hid; and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad fathered Mehujael; and Mehujael fathered Methushael; and Methushael fathered Lamech. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and <span class="add">have</span> cattle. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Lamech said to his wives:</div><div class="q" >Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;</div><div class="q2" >You wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech:</div><div class="q" >For I have slain a man for wounding me,</div><div class="q2" >And a young man for bruising me:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>If Cain will be avenged sevenfold,</div><div class="q2" >Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For, <span class="add">said she</span>, God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh.
