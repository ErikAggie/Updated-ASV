And he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, You will not eat of any tree of the garden? <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat: <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, You will not eat of it, neither will you touch it, lest you die. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the serpent said to the woman, You will not surely die: <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes will be opened, and you will be as God, knowing good and evil. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he did eat. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah God called to the man, and said to him, Where art you? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he said, Who told you that you wast naked? Hast you eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded you that you should not eat? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the man said, The woman whom you gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, cursed art you above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life: <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>and I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed: he will bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pain and your conception; in pain you shall bring forth children; and your desire will be to your husband, and he will rule over you. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And to Adam he said, Because you have hearkened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil shall you eat of it all the days of your life; <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>thorns also and thistles will it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>in the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it wast you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the man called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever— <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
