And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brethren. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Joseph said to his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Haste you, and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus saith your son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down to me, tarry not; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>and you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you, and your children, and your children’s children, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have: <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>and there will I nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh to you. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And you will tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen: and you will haste and bring down my father hither. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brethren, This do you: lade your beasts, and go, get you to the land of Canaan; <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>and take your father and your households, and come to me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now you are commanded, this do you: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that you fall not out by the way. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
