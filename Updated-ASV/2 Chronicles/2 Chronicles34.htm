And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to your servants, they are doing. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the kingâ€™s servant, saying, <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Go you, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written in this book.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>So Hilkiah, and they whom the king <span class="add">had commanded</span>, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they spake to her to that effect. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And she said to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell you the man that sent you to me, <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it will not be quenched. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus will you say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which you have heard, <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>because your heart was tender, and you didst humble yourself before God, when you heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and have humbled yourself before me, and have rent your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither will your eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought back word to the king.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand <span class="add">to it</span>. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
