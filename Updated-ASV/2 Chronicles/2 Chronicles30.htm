For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every one <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>that setteth his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though <span class="add">he be</span> not <span class="add">cleansed</span> according to the purification of the sanctuary. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, <span class="add">singing</span> with loud instruments to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah spake comfortably to all the Levites that had good understanding <span class="add">in the service</span> of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept <span class="add">other</span> seven days with gladness. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
