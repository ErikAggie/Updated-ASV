neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and have chosen David to be over my people Israel. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But Jehovah said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you didst well that it was in your heart: <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son that will come out of your loins, he will build the house for my name. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah hath performed his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>(for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven); <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with your servants, that walk before you with all their heart; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>who have kept with your servant David my father that which you didst promise him: yea, you spakest with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, There will not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you spakest to your servant David.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house which I have builded! <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Yet have you respect to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prayeth before you; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof you have said that you wouldest put your name there; to hearken to the prayer which your servant will pray toward this place. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And hearken you to the supplications of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they will pray toward this place: yea, hear you from your dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when you hearest, forgive.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come <span class="add">and</span> swear before your altar in this house;

when they will come and pray toward this house: <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>then hear you from heaven, even from your dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as doth your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name;
