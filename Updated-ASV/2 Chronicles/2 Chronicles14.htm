In his days the land was quiet ten years. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God: <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
