and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (the same is En-gedi). <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek to Jehovah; and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek <span class="add">help</span> of Jehovah: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and he said, O Jehovah, the God of our fathers, art not you God in heaven? and art not you ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in your hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand you. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Didst not you, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham your friend for ever? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they dwelt therein, and have built you a sanctuary therein for your name, saying, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>If evil come upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before you (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our affliction, and you wilt hear and save. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom you wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not; <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you hast given us to inherit. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>O our God, wilt you not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon you. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Jehovah in the midst of the assembly; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>and he said, Hearken you, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you king Jehoshaphat: Thus saith Jehovah to you, Fear not you, neither be dismayoud by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>To-morrow go you down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and you will find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>You will not need to fight in this <span class="add">battle</span>: set yourselves, stand you still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayoud: to-morrow go out against them; for Jehovah is with you. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah, worshipping Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in Jehovah your God, so will you be established; believe his prophets, so will you prosper. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed them that should sing to Jehovah, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks to Jehovah; for his lovingkindness <span class="add">endureth</span> for ever. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Jehovah: therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets to the house of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest round about.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Howbeit the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly: <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you hast joined yourself with Ahaziah, Jehovah hath destroyed your works. And the ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
