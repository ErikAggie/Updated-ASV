So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Jehovah, which David the king had made to give thanks to Jehovah (for his lovingkindness <span class="add">endureth</span> for ever), when David praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had showed to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he prosperously effected. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Now mine eyes will be open, and mine ears attent, to the prayer that is made in this place. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart will be there perpetually. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And as for you, if you wilt walk before me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances; <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father, saying, There will not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and will go and serve other gods, and worship them; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And this house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it will be astonished, and will say, Why hath Jehovah done thus to this land, and to this house? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And they will answer, Because they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
