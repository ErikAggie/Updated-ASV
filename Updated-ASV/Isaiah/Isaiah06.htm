Then I said, Here am I; send me. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste, <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
