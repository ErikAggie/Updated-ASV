Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>My heart fluttereth, horror hath affrighted me; the twilight that I desired hath been turned into trembling unto me. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman; let him declare what he seeth: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and when he seeth a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights; <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>and, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>O thou my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The burden of Dumah.</div><div class="p" >One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night?
