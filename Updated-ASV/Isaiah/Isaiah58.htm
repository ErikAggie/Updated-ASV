Behold, in the day of your fast you find <span class="add">your own</span> pleasure, and exact all your labors. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: you fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor that are cast out to your house? when you seest the naked, that you cover him; and that you hide not yourself from thine own flesh? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then will your light break forth as the morning, and your healing will spring forth speedily; and your righteousness will go before you; the glory of Jehovah will be your rearward. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then shall you call, and Jehovah will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, Here I am.</div><div class="p" >If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then will your light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday; <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>and Jehovah will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make strong your bones; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they that will be of you will build the old waste places; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>If you turn away your foot from the sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, <span class="add">and</span> the holy of Jehovah honorable; and shall honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking <span class="add">thine own</span> words: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>then shall you delight yourself in Jehovah; and I will make you to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
