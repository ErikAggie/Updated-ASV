And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country to me, even from Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then said he, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day, will be carried to Babylon: nothing will be left, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And of your sons that will issue from you, whom you shall father, will they take away; and they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which you have spoken. He said moreover, For there will be peace and truth in my days.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
