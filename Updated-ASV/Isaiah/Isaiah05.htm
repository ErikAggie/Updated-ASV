My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>and he digged it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it will be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof, and it will be trodden down: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and I will lay it waste; it will not be pruned nor hoed; but there will come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Woe to them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and you be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land! <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>In mine ears <span class="add">saith</span> Jehovah of hosts, Of a truth many houses will be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For ten acres of vineyard will yield one bath, and a homer of seed will yield <span class="add">but</span> an ephah. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Woe to them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them! <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are <span class="add">in</span> their feasts; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore Sheol hath enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, descend <span class="add">into it</span>. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled: <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then will the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones will wanderers eat.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Woe to them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it! <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Woe to them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Woe to them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom will go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they will come with speed swiftly. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>None will be weary nor stumble among them; none will slumber nor sleep; neither will the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses’ hoofs will be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>their roaring will be like a lioness, they will roar like young lions; yea, they will roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there will be none to deliver. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And they will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look to the land, behold, darkness <span class="add">and</span> distress; and the light is darkened in the clouds thereof.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
