These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom, <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants’ sake, that I may not destroy them all. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen will inherit it, and my servants will dwell there. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Sharon will be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But you that forsake Jehovah, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine to Destiny; <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>I will destine you to the sword, and you will all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer; when I spake, you did not hear; but you did that which was evil in mine eyous, and chose that wherein I delighted not.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants will eat, but you will be hungry; behold, my servants will drink, but you will be thirsty; behold, my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame; <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>behold, my servants will sing for joy of heart, but you will cry for sorrow of heart, and will wail for vexation of spirit. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And you will leave your name for a curse to my chosen; and the Lord Jehovah will slay you; and he will call his servants by another name: <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>so that he who blesseth himself in the earth will bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth will swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be remembered, nor come into mind. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But be you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there will be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>There will be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child will die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old will be accursed. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And they will build houses, and inhabit them; and they will plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>They will not build, and another inhabit; they will not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree will be the days of my people, and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>They will not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
