God knoweth. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if <span class="add">ye do</span>, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise <span class="add">yourselves</span>. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you <span class="add">captive</span>, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Of the Jews five times received I forty <span class="add">stripes</span> save one. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">in</span> journeyings often, <span class="add">in</span> perils of rivers, <span class="add">in</span> perils of robbers, <span class="add">in</span> perils from <span class="add">my</span> countrymen, <span class="add">in</span> perils from the Gentiles, <span class="add">in</span> perils in the city, <span class="add">in</span> perils in the wilderness, <span class="add">in</span> perils in the sea, <span class="add">in</span> perils among false brethren; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">in</span> labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not? <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me: <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
