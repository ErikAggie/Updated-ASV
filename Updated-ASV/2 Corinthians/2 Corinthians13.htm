At the mouth of two witnesses or three will every word be established. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to them that have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare; <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>seeing that you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me; who to you-ward is not weak, but is powerful in you: <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>for he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward you. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Try your own selves, whether you are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or know you not as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you? unless indeed you be reprobate. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But I hope that you will know that we are not reprobate. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now we pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though we be as reprobate. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For we rejoice, when we are weak, and you are strong: this we also pray for, even your perfecting. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected; be comforted; be of the same mind; live in peace: and the God of love and peace will be with you. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Salute one another with a holy kiss.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>All the saints salute you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
