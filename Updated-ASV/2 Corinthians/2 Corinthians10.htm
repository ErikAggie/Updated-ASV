If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ’s, so also are we. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I will not be put to shame: <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <span class="add">are we</span> also in deed when we are present. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But we will not glory beyond <span class="add">our</span> measure, but according to the measure of the province which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even to you. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not to you: for we came even as far as to you in the gospel of Christ: <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>not glorying beyond <span class="add">our</span> measure, <span class="add">that is,</span> in other men’s labors; but having hope that, as your faith groweth, we will be magnified in you according to our province to <span class="add">further</span> abundance, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>so as to preach the gospel even to the parts beyond you, <span class="add">and </span> not to glory in another’s province in regard of things ready to our hand. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
