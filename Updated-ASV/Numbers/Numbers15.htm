<span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>then will he that offereth his oblation offer to Jehovah a meal-offering of a tenth part <span class="add">of an ephah</span> of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil: <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shall you prepare with the burnt-offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts <span class="add">of an ephah</span> of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and for the drink-offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And when you preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace-offerings to Jehovah;

as you do, so he will do. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For the assembly, there will be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth <span class="add">with you</span>, a statute for ever throughout your generations: as you are, so will the sojourner be before Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>One law and one ordinance will be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spake to Moses, saying, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land whither I bring you, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>then it will be, that, when you eat of the bread of the land, you will offer up a heave-offering to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Of the first of your dough you will offer up a cake for a heave-offering: as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so will you heave it. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Of the first of your dough you will give to Jehovah a heave-offering throughout your generations.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And when you will err, and not observe all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken to Moses, <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>even all that Jehovah hath commanded you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations; <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>then it will be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation will offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor to Jehovah, with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin-offering. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And the priest will make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they will be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire to Jehovah, and their sin-offering before Jehovah, for their error: <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and all the congregation of the children of Israel will be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;

and he will be forgiven. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>You will have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is home-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemeth Jehovah; and that soul will be cut off from among his people. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Because he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment, that soul will utterly be cut off; his iniquity will be upon him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, The man will surely be put to death: all the congregation will stone him with stones without the camp. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spake to Moses, saying, <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue: <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>and it will be to you for a fringe, that you may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and that you follow not after your own heart and your own eyous, after which you use to play the harlot; <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
