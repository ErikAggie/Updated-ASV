and you and your sons with you will bear the iniquity of your priesthood. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And your brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring you near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and your sons with you will be before the tent of the testimony. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And they will keep your charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they will not come nigh to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor you. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they will be joined to you, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger will not come nigh to you. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And you will keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given to Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And you and your sons with you will keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and you will serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh will be put to death.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spake to Aaron, And I, behold, I have given you the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion for ever. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>This will be your of the most holy things, <span class="add">reserved</span> from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they will render to me, will be most holy for you and for your sons. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>As the most holy things shall you eat thereof; every male will eat thereof: it will be holy to you. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And this is your: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in your house will eat thereof. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give to Jehovah, to you have I given them. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Jehovah, will be your; every one that is clean in your house will eat thereof. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Everything devoted in Israel will be your. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer to Jehovah, both of man and beast will be your: nevertheless the first-born of man shall you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shall you redeem. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shall you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs). <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy: you shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the flesh of them will be your, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it will be your. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to Jehovah, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah to you and to your seed with you. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them: I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And to the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And henceforth the children of Israel will not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But the Levites will do the service of the tent of meeting, and they will bear their iniquity: it will be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they will have no inheritance. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering to Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they will have no inheritance.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spake to Moses, saying, <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and say to them, When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you will offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And your heave-offering will be reckoned to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Thus you also will offer a heave-offering to Jehovah of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and thereof you will give Jehovah’s heave-offering to Aaron the priest. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Out of all your gifts you will offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Therefore you shall say to them, When you heave the best thereof from it, then it will be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And you will eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And you will bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it the best thereof: and you will not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that you die not.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
