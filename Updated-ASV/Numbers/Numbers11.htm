<span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to Jehovah, Wherefore hast you dealt ill with your servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in your sight, that you layest the burden of all this people upon me? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that you shouldest say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, to the land which you swarest to their fathers? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And if you deal thus with me, kill me, I pray you, out of hand, if I have found favor in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon you, and will put it upon them; and they will bear the burden of the people with you, that you bear it not yourself alone. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and you will eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and you will eat. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>You will not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days, <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you; because that you have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred yousand footmen; and you hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or will all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, Is Jehovah’s hand waxed short? now shall you see whether my word will come to pass to you or not.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to him, Art you jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah’s people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them! <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
