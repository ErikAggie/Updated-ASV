And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Come now therefore, I pray you, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I will prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you blessest is blessed, and he whom you cursest is cursed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spake to him the words of Balak. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Jehovah will speak to me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with you? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent to me, <span class="add">saying</span>, <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I will be able to fight against them, and will drive them out. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people; for they are blessed. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Get you into your land; for Jehovah refuseth to give me leave to go with you. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray you, hinder you from coming to me: <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatsoever you sayest to me I will do: come therefore, I pray you, curse me this people. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry you also here this night, that I may know what Jehovah will speak to me more. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men are come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that shall you do.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And God’s anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Jehovah placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And the angel of Jehovah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you hast smitten me these three times? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said to the ass, Because you hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed you. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I your ass, upon which you hast ridden all your life long to this day? was I ever wont to do so to you? and he said, Nay.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And the angel of Jehovah said to him, Wherefore hast you smitten your ass these three times? behold, I am come for an adversary, because your way is perverse before me: <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain you, and saved her alive. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said to the angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that you stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And the angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I will speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to you to call you? wherefore camest you not to me? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor? <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I am come to you: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that will I speak. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
