And Moses prayed for the people. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it will come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, will live. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>From there they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>From there they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah,</div><div class="q" >Vaheb in Suphah,</div><div class="q" >And the valleys of the Arnon,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the slope of the valleys</div><div class="q" >That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar,</div><div class="q" >And leaneth upon the border of Moab.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And from there <span class="add">they journeyed</span> to Beer: that is the well whereof Jehovah said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then sang Israel this song:</div><div class="q" >Spring up, O well;

we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the kingâ€™s highway, until we have passed your border. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say,</div><div class="q" >Come you to Heshbon;</div><div class="q" >Let the city of Sihon be built and established:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For a fire is gone out of Heshbon,</div><div class="q" >A flame from the city of Sihon:</div><div class="q" >It hath devoured Ar of Moab,</div><div class="q" >The lords of the high places of the Arnon.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Woe to you, Moab!</div><div class="q" >You art undone, O people of Chemosh:</div><div class="q" >He hath given his sons as fugitives,</div><div class="q" >And his daughters into captivity,</div><div class="q" >Unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>We have shot at them;

and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
