And they fell upon their faces. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to Aaron, Take your censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah; the plague is begun. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
