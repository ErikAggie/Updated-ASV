her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, will he burn: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and the priest will take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then the priest will wash his clothes, and he will bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he will come into the camp, and the priest will be unclean until the even. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he that burneth her will wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and will be unclean until the even. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And a man that is clean will gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place;
