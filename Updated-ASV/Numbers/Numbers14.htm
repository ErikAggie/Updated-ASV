Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and they spake to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>If Jehovah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither fear you the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting to all the children of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you broughtest up this people in your might from among them; <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you Jehovah art in the midst of this people; for you Jehovah art seen face to face, and your cloud standeth over them, and you goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Now if you shall kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware to them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And now, I pray you, let the power of the Lord be great, according as you hast spoken, saying, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will by no means clear <span class="add">the guilty</span>, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Pardon, I pray you, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your lovingkindness, and according as you hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to your word: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth will be filled with the glory of Jehovah; <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>because all those men that have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>surely they will not see the land which I sware to their fathers, neither will any of them that despised me see it: <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed will possess it. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spake to Moses and to Aaron, saying, <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>How long <span class="add">will I bear</span> with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Say to them, As I live, saith Jehovah, surely as you have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>your dead bodies will fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me, <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>surely you will not come into the land, concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>But your little ones, that you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they will know the land which you have rejected. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>But as for you, your dead bodies will fall in this wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And your children will be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and will bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a youar, will you bear your iniquities, even forty youars, and you will know my alienation. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely this will I do to all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they will be consumed, and there they will die.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land, <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And Moses told these words to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up to the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have sinned. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And Moses said, Wherefore now do you transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it will not prosper? <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that you be not smitten down before your enemies. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you will fall by the sword: because you are turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even to Hormah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
