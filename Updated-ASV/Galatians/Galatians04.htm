Ye did me no wrong: <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, <span class="add">even</span> as Christ Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in youâ€” <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Howbeit the <span class="add">son</span> by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the <span class="add">son</span> by the freewoman <span class="add">is born</span> through promise. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Which things contain an allegory: for these <span class="add">women</span> are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For it is written,</div><div class="q" >Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;</div><div class="q" >Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not:</div><div class="q" >For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him <span class="add">that was born</span> after the Spirit, so also it is now. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
