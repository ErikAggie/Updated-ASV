He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; <span class="add">and it was </span> ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Now a mediator is not <span class="add">a mediator</span> of one; but God is one. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But the scripture shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>So that the law is become our tutor <span class="add">to bring us</span> unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one <span class="add">man</span> in Christ Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
