Moreover I tell you that Jehovah will build you a house. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>I will be his father, and he will be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you; <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne will be established for ever. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And this was a small thing in your eyes, O God; but you have spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>What can David <span class="add">say</span> yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? for you knowest your servant. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>O Jehovah, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, have you wrought all this greatness, to make known all <span class="add">these</span> great things. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>O Jehovah, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemest out of Egypt? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For your people Israel didst you make your own people for ever; and you, Jehovah, becamest their God. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And now, O Jehovah, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as you have spoken. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And let your name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David your servant is established before you. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For you, O my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house: therefore hath your servant found <span class="add">in his heart</span> to pray before you. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And now, O Jehovah, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and now it hath pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you: for you, O Jehovah, have blessed, and it is blessed for ever.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
