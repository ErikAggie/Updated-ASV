Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now put away, I beseech you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spake to Gad, David’s seer, saying, <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Go and speak to David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do it to you. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which you will: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtaketh you; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I will return to him that sent me. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay your hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And David said to God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray you, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Jehovah: for the full price shall you give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Ornan said to David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give <span class="add">thee</span> the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is your for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
