And he answered, Nothing: howbeit only let me depart.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And God raised up <span class="add">another</span> adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them <span class="add">of Zobah</span>: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad <span class="add">did</span>: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now <span class="add">Ahijah </span> had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he said to Jeroboam, Take you ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>(but he will have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel); <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and <span class="add">to keep</span> my statutes and mine ordinances, as did David his father. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes; <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desireth, and shall be king over Israel. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And it will be, if you wilt hearken to all that I command you, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
