And the people departed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this people? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And they spake to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants for ever. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, What counsel give you, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that your father did put upon us lighter? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the young men that were grown up with him spake to him, saying, Thus shall you say to this people that spake to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you speak to them, My little finger is thicker than my fatherâ€™s loins. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So the king hearkened not to the people; for it was a thing brought about of Jehovah, that he might establish his word, which Jehovah spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying, <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, You will not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened to the word of Jehovah, and returned and went their way, according to the word of Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from there, and built Penuel. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of David: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And this thing became a sin; for the people went <span class="add">to worship </span> before the one, even to Dan. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, that were not of the sons of Levi. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; so did he in Beth-el, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places that he had made. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And he went up to the altar which he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
