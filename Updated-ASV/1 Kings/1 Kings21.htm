And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eatest no bread? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said to her, Because I spake to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you <span class="add">another</span> vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Jezebel his wife said to him, Dost you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, <span class="add">and</span> that dwelt with Naboth. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him to death.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bare witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast you killed, and also taken possession? And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth will dogs lick your blood, even thine. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast you found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found you, because you hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation wherewith you hast provoked me to anger, and hast made Israel to sin. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And of Jezebel also spake Jehovah, saying, The dogs will eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs will eat; and him that dieth in the field will the birds of the heavens eat. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>(But there was none like to Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.)</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Seest you how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son’s day will I bring the evil upon his house.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
