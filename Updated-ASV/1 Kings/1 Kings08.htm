even these did the priests and the Levites bring up. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are to this day. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah, <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in for ever. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth to David your father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But Jehovah said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you didst well that it was in your heart: <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son that will come out of your loins, he will build the house for my name. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with your servants, that walk before you with all their heart; <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>who hast kept with your servant David my father that which you didst promise him: yea, you spakest with your mouth, and hast fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you hast promised him, saying, There will not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk before me as you hast walked before me. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O God of Israel, let your word, I pray you, be verified, which you spakest to your servant David my father.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have builded! <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Yet have you respect to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prayeth before you this day; <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof you hast said, My name will be there; to hearken to the prayer which your servant will pray toward this place. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And hearken you to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they will pray toward this place: yea, hear you in heaven your dwelling-place; and when you hearest, forgive.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come <span class="add">and</span> swear before thine altar in this house; <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>When your people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; if they turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you in this house: <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gavest to their fathers.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you dost afflict them: <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon your land, which you hast given to your people for an inheritance.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting <span class="add">or</span> mildew, locust <span class="add">or</span> caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, <span class="add">or </span> by all your people Israel, who will know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>then hear you in heaven your dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you knowest; (for you, even you only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;) <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gavest to our fathers.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of your people Israel, when he will come out of a far country for your name’s sake <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>(for they will hear of your great name, and of your mighty hand, and of thine outstretched arm); when he will come and pray toward this house; <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>hear you in heaven your dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as doth your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way you shall send them, and they pray to Jehovah toward the city which you hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name;

<span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gavest to their fathers, the city which you hast chosen, and the house which I have built for your name: <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven your dwelling-place, and maintain their cause; <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>(for they are your people, and thine inheritance, which you broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron); <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>that thine eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people Israel, to hearken to them whensoever they cry to you. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>For you didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as you spakest by Moses your servant, when you broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven. <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>Blessed be Jehovah, that hath given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant. <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>Jehovah our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us; <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers. <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before Jehovah, be nigh to Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day will require; <span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else. <span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered to Jehovah, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings. <span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span>So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. <span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had showed to David his servant, and to Israel his people.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
