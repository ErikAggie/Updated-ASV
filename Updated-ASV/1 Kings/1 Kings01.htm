And the king said, What wouldest you? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And she said to him, My lord, you swarest by Jehovah your God to your handmaid, <span class="add">saying</span>, Assuredly Solomon your son will reign after me, and he will sit upon my throne. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and you, my lord the king, knowest it not: <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon your servant hath he not called. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And you, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king will sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah will reign after me, and he will sit upon my throne? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, <span class="add">Long</span> live king Adonijah. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, hath he not called. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not showed to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>verily as I sware to you by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son will reign after me, and he will sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon: <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow you the trumpet, and say, <span class="add">Long</span> live king Solomon. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Then you will come up after him, and he will come and sit upon my throne; for he will be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so <span class="add">too</span>. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>As Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, <span class="add">Long </span> live king Solomon. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar? <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bringest good tidings. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king: <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule; <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne: and the king bowed himself upon the bed. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there will not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he will die. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
