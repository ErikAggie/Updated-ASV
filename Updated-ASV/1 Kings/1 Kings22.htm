And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you art, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray you, for the word of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or will I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shall you push the Syrians, until they be consumed. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets <span class="add">declare</span> good to the king with one mouth: let your word, I pray you, be like the word of one of them, and speak you good. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith to me, that will I speak. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And when he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, will we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or will we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the king said to him, How many times will I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And <span class="add">Micaiah</span> said, Therefore hear you the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said, Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shall entice him, and shall prevail also: go forth, and do so. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak to you? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, you peoples, all of you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put you on your robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves <span class="add">there</span>); according to the word of Jehovah which he spake. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah: howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And the remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
