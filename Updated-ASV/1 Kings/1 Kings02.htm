And she said, Comest you peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to you. And she said, Say on. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said, You knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s; for it was his from Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And now I ask one petition of you; deny me not. And she said to him, Say on. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he said, Speak, I pray you, to Solomon the king (for he will not say you nay), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Bath-sheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then she said, I ask one small petition of you; deny me not. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother to wife. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Then king Solomon sware by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Now therefore as Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah will be put to death this day. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because you wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the Tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled to the Tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And the king said to him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that you mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not, <span class="add">to wit</span>, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>So will their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, will there be peace for ever from Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build you a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth there any whither. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For on the day you goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know you for certain that you shall surely die: your blood will be upon your own head. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will your servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not adjure you by Jehovah, and protest to you, saying, Know for certain, that on the day you goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, you shall surely die? and you saidst to me, The saying that I have heard is good. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Why then have you not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged you with? <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>The king said moreover to Shimei, You knowest all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you didst to David my father: therefore Jehovah will return your wickedness upon your own head. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>But king Solomon will be blessed, and the throne of David will be established before Jehovah for ever. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
