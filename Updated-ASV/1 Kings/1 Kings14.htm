Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shall you say to her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam; why feignest you yourself to be another? for I am sent to you with heavy tidings. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over my people Israel, <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>but have done evil above all that were before you, and have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city will the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field will the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah hath spoken it. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Arise you therefore, get you to your house: <span class="add">and</span> when your feet enter into the city, the child will die. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And all Israel will mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam will come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Moreover Jehovah will raise him up a king over Israel, who will cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For Jehovah will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Jehovah to anger. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath sinned, and with what he hath made Israel to sin.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: <span class="add">and </span> as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree; <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>and there were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Jehovah drove out before the children of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And it was so, that, as oft as the king went into the house of Jehovah, the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
