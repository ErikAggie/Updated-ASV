And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he came there to a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said to him, What do you here, Elijah? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before Jehovah; but Jehovah was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but Jehovah was not in the earthquake: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and after the earthquake a fire; but Jehovah was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice to him, and said, What do you here, Elijah? <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when you comest, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria; <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>and Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael will Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu will Elisha slay. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Yet will I leave <span class="add">me</span> seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke <span class="add">of oxen</span> before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to him, and cast his mantle upon him. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you. And he said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to you? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
