But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and forsookest them not. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God that brought you up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>yet you in your manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>You gavest also your good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not your manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Yes, forty years didst you sustain them in the wilderness, <span class="add">and </span> they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Moreover you gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which you didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Their children also multipliedst you as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land concerning which you didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns cut out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and slew your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they wrought great provocations. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Therefore you deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heardest from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore leftest you them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heardest from heaven; and many times didst you deliver them according to your mercies, <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>and testifiedst against them, that you mightest bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances (which if a man do, he shall live in them), and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Yet many years didst you bear with them, and testifiedst against them by your Spirit through your prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest you them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before you, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Howbeit you are just in all that is come upon us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly; <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor hearkened to your commandments and your testimonies with what you didst testify against them. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gavest them, and in the large and fat land which you gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that you gavest to our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And it yieldeth much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, <span class="add">and</span> our priests, seal to it.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
