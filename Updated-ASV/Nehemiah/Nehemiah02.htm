Now I had not been <span class="add">beforetime</span> sad in his presence. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And I said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then the king said to me, For what dost you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if your servant have found favor in your sight, that you wouldest send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the king said to me (the queen also sitting by him), For how long will your journey be? and when wilt you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Moreover I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come to Judah; <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I will enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal’s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king’s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then said I to them, You see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good <span class="add">work</span>. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do? will you rebel against the king? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then answered I them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
