Yea, I and my fatherâ€™s house have sinned: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>we have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commandedst your servant Moses. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Remember, I beseech you, the word that you commandedst your servant Moses, saying, If you trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples: <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yout will I gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Now these are your servants and your people, whom you hast redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>O Lord, I beseech you, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your name; and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.</div><div class="p" >Now I was cupbearer to the king.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
