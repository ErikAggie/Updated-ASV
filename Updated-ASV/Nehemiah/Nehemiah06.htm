But they thought to do me mischief. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand, <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that you and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause you are building the wall: and you wouldest be their king, according to these words. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And you hast also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now will it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as you sayest, but you feignest them out of your own heart. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, <span class="add">O God</span>, strengthen you my hands.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yea, in the night will they come to slay you. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <span class="add">day</span> of <span class="add">the month</span> Elul, in fifty and two days. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard <span class="add">thereof</span>, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and <span class="add">the letters</span> of Tobiah came to them. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. <span class="add">And</span> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
