<span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Jehovah hath destroyed them to this day; <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>but your eyes have seen all the great work of Jehovah which he did.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore will you keep all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither you go over to possess it; <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Jehovah sware to your fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For the land, whither you goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence you came out, where you sowedst your seed, and wateredst it with your foot, as a garden of herbs; <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>but the land, whither you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, <span class="add">and</span> drinketh water of the rain of heaven, <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>a land which Jehovah your God careth for: the eyes of Jehovah your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, if you will hearken diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you mayest gather in your grain, and your new wine, and your oil. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And I will give grass in your fields for your cattle, and you shall eat and be full. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>and the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Jehovah giveth you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Therefore will you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and you will bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they will be for frontlets between your eyes. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And you will teach them your children, talking of them, when you sittest in your house, and when you walkest by the way, and when you liest down, and when you risest up. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And you shall write them upon the door-posts of your house, and upon your gates; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For if you will diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave to him; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>then will Jehovah drive out all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Every place whereon the sole of your foot will tread will be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea will be your border. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>There will no man be able to stand before you: Jehovah your God will lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you will tread upon, as he hath spoken to you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>the blessing, if you will hearken to the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you this day; <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>and the curse, if you will not hearken to the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which you have not known. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, when Jehovah your God will bring you into the land whither you goest to possess it, that you shall set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth you, and you will possess it, and dwell therein. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And you will observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
