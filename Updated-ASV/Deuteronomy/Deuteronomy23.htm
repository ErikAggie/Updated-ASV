even to the tenth generation will none of his enter into the assembly of Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>An Ammonite or a Moabite will not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation will none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Jehovah for ever: <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless Jehovah your God would not hearken to Balaam; but Jehovah your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because Jehovah your God loved you. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days for ever.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>You shall not abhor an Edomite;

and when the sun is down, he will come within the camp. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>You shall have a place also wiyout the camp, whither you shall go forth abroad: <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>and you shall have a paddle among your weapons; and it will be, when you sittest down abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall turn back and cover that which cometh from you: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>for Jehovah your God walketh in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up thine enemies before you; therefore will your camp be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>You shall not deliver to his master a servant that is escaped from his master to you: <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>he will dwell with you, in the midst of you, in the place which he will choose within one of your gates, where it pleaseth him best: you shall not oppress him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>There will be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither will there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>You shall not bring the hire of a harlot, or the wages of a dog, into the house of Jehovah your God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination to Jehovah your God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>You shall not lend upon interest to your brother;
