and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But unto the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and there ye shall eat before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes;
