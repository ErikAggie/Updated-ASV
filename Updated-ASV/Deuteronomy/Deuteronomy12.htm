and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and you shall destroy their name out of that place. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>You shall not do so to Jehovah your God. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even to his habitation shall you seek, and there you shall come; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and there you shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and there you shall eat before Jehovah your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, wherein Jehovah your God hath blessed you. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes;

you shall pour it out upon the earth as water. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>You mayest not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstlings of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vowest, nor your freewill-offerings, nor the heave-offering of your hand;
