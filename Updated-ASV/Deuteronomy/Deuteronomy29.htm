<span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>the great trials which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders: <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>but Jehovah hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxed old upon you, and your shoe is not waxed old upon your foot. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Ye have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am Jehovah your God. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we smote them: <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel, <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>your little ones, your wives, and your sojourner that is in the midst of your camps, from the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water; <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>that you mayest enter into the covenant of Jehovah your God, and into his oath, which Jehovah your God maketh with you this day; <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>that he may establish you this day to himself for a people, and that he may be to you a God, as he spake to you, and as he sware to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath, <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>but with him that standeth here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>(for you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed; <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>and you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them); <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I will have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Jehovah will not pardon him, but then the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book will lie upon him, and Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the generation to come, your children that will rise up after you, and the foreigner that will come from a far land, will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith Jehovah hath made it sick; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">and that</span> the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, <span class="add">and</span> a burning, <span class="add">that</span> it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>even all the nations will say, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus to this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Then men will say, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not given to them: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book; <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>The secret things belong to Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
