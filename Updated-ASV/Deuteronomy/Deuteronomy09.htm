But Jehovah hearkened to me that time also. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you provoked Jehovah to wrath. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then you rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God, and you believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>You have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Jehovah had said he would destroy you. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And I prayed to Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, destroy not your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin, <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>lest the land whence you broughtest us out say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you broughtest out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
