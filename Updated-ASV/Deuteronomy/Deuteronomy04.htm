that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, giveth you. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>You will not add to the word which I command you, neither will you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I command you. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-peor; for all the men that followed Baal-peor, Jehovah your God hath destroyed them from the midst of you. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But you that did cleave to Jehovah your God are alive every one of you this day. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Jehovah my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst of the land whither you go in to possess it. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, that will hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For what great nation is there, that hath a god so nigh to them, as Jehovah our God is whensoever we call upon him? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>the day that you stoodest before Jehovah your God in Horeb, when Jehovah said to me, Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spake to you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; only <span class="add">you heard</span> a voice. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land whither you go over to possess it.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Take you therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner of form on the day that Jehovah spake to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire; <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>lest you corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flieth in the heavens, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and lest you lift up thine eyes to heaven, and when you seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, you be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Jehovah your God hath allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But Jehovah hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Furthermore Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which Jehovah your God giveth you for an inheritance: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you will go over, and possess that good land. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image in the form of anything which Jehovah your God hath forbidden you. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For Jehovah your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>When you shall father children, and children’s children, and you will have been long in the land, and will corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and will do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah your God, to provoke him to anger; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over the Jordan to possess it; you will not prolong your days upon it, but will utterly be destroyoud. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations, whither Jehovah will lead you away. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And there you will serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But from thence you will seek Jehovah your God, and you shall find him, when you searchest after him with all your heart and with all your soul. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>When you art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon you, in the latter days you shall return to Jehovah your God, and hearken to his voice: <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>for Jehovah your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he sware to them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven to the other, whether there hath been <span class="add">any such thing</span> as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you hast heard, and live? <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of <span class="add">another</span> nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Jehovah your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Unto you it was showed, that you mightest know that Jehovah he is God; there is none else besides him. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and upon earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that Jehovah he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And you shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you mayest prolong your days in the land, which Jehovah your God giveth you, for ever.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;
