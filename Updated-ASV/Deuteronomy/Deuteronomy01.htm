<span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And you answered me, and said, The thing which you hast spoken is good <span class="add">for us</span> to do. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear <span class="add">the causes </span> between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner that is with him. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>You will not respect persons in judgment; you will hear the small and the great alike; you will not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you you will bring to me, and I will hear it. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And we journeyoud from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And I said to you, You are come to the hill-country of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth to us. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Behold, Jehovah your God hath set the land before you: go up, take possession, as Jehovah, the God of your fathers, hath spoken to you; fear not, neither be dismayed. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And you came near to me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we will come. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe: <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Jehovah our God giveth to us.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>and in the wilderness, where you hast seen how that Jehovah your God bare you, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Yet in this thing you did not believe Jehovah your God, <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Surely there will not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give to your fathers, <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he will see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Also Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in there: <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before you, he will go in there: encourage you him; for he will cause Israel to inherit it. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Moreover your little ones, that you said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they will go in there, and to them will I give it, and they will possess it. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And you girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to me, Say to them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be smitten before your enemies. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>So I spake to you, and you hearkened not; but you rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>And you returned and wept before Jehovah; but Jehovah hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear to you. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>So you abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you abode <span class="add">there</span>.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
