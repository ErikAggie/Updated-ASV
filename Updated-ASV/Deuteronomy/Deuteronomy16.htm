seven days shall you eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for you camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you mayest remember the day when you camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And there will be no leaven seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither will any of the flesh, which you sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>You mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of your gates, which Jehovah your God giveth you; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>but at the place which Jehovah your God will choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you camest forth out of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And you shall roast and eat it in the place which Jehovah your God will choose: and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Six days you shall eat unleavened bread;
