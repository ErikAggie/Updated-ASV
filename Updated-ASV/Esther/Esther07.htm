But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s damage. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then spake the king Ahasuerus and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine <span class="add">and went </span> into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him thereon. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain. This modification is Copyright 2019 by Erik Peterson.
