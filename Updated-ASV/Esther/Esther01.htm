So <span class="add">will there arise</span> much contempt and wrath. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another that is better than she. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And when the king’s decree which he will make will be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
