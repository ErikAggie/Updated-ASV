Then said the king’s servants that ministered to him, There is nothing done for him. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the king’s servants said to him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What will be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor, <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set: <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus will it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as you hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that you hast spoken. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus will it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife to him, If Mordecai, before whom you hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, you shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>While they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
