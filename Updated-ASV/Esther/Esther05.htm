So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Then said the king to her, What wilt you, queen Esther? and what is your request? it shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Esther said, If it seem good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition? and it shall be granted you: and what is your request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is: <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Haman said moreover, Yes, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak you to the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go you in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
