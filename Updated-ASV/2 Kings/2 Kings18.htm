And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah gave <span class="add">him</span> all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king’s house. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>At that time did Hezekiah cut off <span class="add">the gold from</span> the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and <span class="add">from</span> the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Rabshakeh said to them, Say you now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein you trustest? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>You sayest (but they are but vain words), <span class="add">There is</span> counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost you trust, that you hast rebelled against me? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Now, behold, you trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But if you say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You will worship before this altar in Jerusalem? <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders upon them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Am I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But Rabshakeh said to them, Hath my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? <span class="add">hath he</span> not <span class="add">sent me</span> to the men that sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spake, saying, Hear you the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand: <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat you every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink you every one the waters of his own cistern; <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and hearken not to Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
