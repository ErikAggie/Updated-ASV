<span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, that sittest <span class="add">above</span> the cherubim, you art the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you hast made heaven and earth. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to defy the living God. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save you us, I beseech you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you Jehovah art God alone.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas you hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard <span class="add">you</span>. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>This is the word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at you. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Whom hast you defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast you exalted your voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? <span class="add">even</span> against the Holy One of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>By your messengers you hast defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into his farthest lodging-place, the forest of his fruitful field. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Hast you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Because of your raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you camest.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And this will be the sign to you: you will eat this youar that which groweth of itself, and in the second youar that which springeth of the same; and in the third youar sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that will escape: the zeal of Jehovah will perform this. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>By the way that he came, by the same will he return, and he will not come to this city, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat.
