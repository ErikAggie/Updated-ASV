And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as your soul liveth, I will not leave you. So they went down to Beth-el. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest you that Jehovah will take away your master from your head to-day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold you your peace. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as your soul liveth, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest you that Jehovah will take away your master from your head to-day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold you your peace. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray you; for Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as your soul liveth, I will not leave you. And they two went on. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and there, so that they two went over on dry ground. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I will do for you, before I am taken from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he said, You have asked a hard thing: <span class="add">nevertheless</span>, if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so to you; but if not, it will not be so. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, <span class="add">there appeared</span> a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!</div><div class="p" >And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and there; and Elisha went over.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You will not send. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, we pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, I have healed these waters; there will not be from there any more death or miscarrying. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he went up from there to Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two lads of them. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
