And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying, <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Go you, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they communed with her. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And she said to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell you the man that sent you to me, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus will you say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which you hast heard, <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>because your heart was tender, and you didst humble yourself before Jehovah, when you heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither will thine eyes see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.
