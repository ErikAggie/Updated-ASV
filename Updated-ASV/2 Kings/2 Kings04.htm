And she said, Your handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And you shall go in, and shut the door upon you and upon your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and you shall set aside that which is full. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought <span class="add">the vessels</span> to her, and she poured out. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your sons of the rest.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Let us make, I pray you, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a candlestick: and it will be, when he cometh to us, that he will turn in there. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and lay there. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? wouldest you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he said, At this season, when the time cometh round, you shall embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said to her. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut <span class="add">the door</span> upon him, and went out. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he said, Wherefore wilt you go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It will be well. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid you. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>So she went, and came to the man of God to mount Carmel.</div><div class="p" >And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite: <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>run, I pray you, now to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Jehovah hath hid it from me, and hath not told me. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah liveth, and as your soul liveth, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in to him, he said, Take up your son. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith Jehovah, They will eat, and will leave thereof. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of Jehovah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
