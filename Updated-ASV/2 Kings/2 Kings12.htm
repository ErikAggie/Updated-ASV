now therefore take no <span class="add">more</span> money from your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the priests consented that they should take no <span class="add">more</span> money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of Jehovah: and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought upon the house of Jehovah, <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But there were not made for the house of Jehovah cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah; <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>for they gave that to them that did the work, and repaired therewith the house of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work; for they dealt faithfully. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The money for the trespass-offerings, and the money for the sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Jehovah: it was the priests’.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and of the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
