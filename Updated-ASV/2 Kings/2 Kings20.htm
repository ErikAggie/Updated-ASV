And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah, saying, <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Jehovah came to him, saying, <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you; on the third day you shall go up to the house of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant Davidâ€™s sake. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah the third day? <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign to you from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah the prophet cried to Jehovah; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to you? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And of your sons that shall issue from you, whom you shall father, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which you have spoken. He said moreover, Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
