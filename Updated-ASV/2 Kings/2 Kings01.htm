And Elijah departed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why is it that you are returned? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from the bed whither you art gone up, but shall surely die. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then <span class="add">the king</span> sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spake to him, O man of God, the king hath said, Come down. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Elijah answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as you hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down from the bed whither you art gone up, but shall surely die.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>So he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
