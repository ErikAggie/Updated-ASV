<span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Neither said they, Where is Jehovah that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man dwelt? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? and they that handle the law knew me not: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I will yet contend with you, saith Jehovah, and with your childrenâ€™s children will I contend. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there hath been such a thing. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Hath a nation changed <span class="add">its</span> gods, which yet are no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Be astonished, O you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be you very desolate, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Is Israel a servant? is he a home-born <span class="add">slave</span>? why is he become a prey? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>The young lions have roared upon him, and yelled; and they have made his land waste: his cities are burned up, without inhabitant. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Hast you not procured this to yourself, in that you hast forsaken Jehovah your God, when he led you by the way? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And now what hast you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? or what hast you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Thine own wickedness will correct you, and your backslidings will reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that you hast forsaken Jehovah your God, and that my fear is not in you, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you saidst, I will not serve; for upon every high hill and under every green tree you didst bow yourself, playing the harlot. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For though you wash you with lye, and take you much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>How can you say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baalim? see your way in the valley, know what you hast done: <span class="add">you art</span> a swift dromedary traversing her ways; <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they will find her. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst. But you saidst, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>who say to a stock, You art my father; and to a stone, You hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But where are your gods that you hast made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Wherefore will you contend with me? you all have transgressed against me, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>O generation, see you the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? or a land of thick darkness? wherefore say my people, We are broken loose; we will come no more to you? <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>How trimmest you your way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women hast you taught your ways. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: you didst not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Yet you saidst, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with you, because you sayest, I have not sinned. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Why gaddest you about so much to change your way? you shall be ashamed of Egypt also, as you wast ashamed of Assyria. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>From there also shall you go forth, with your hands upon your head: for Jehovah hath rejected those in whom you trustest, and you shall not prosper with them.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
