Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth Malcam possess Gad, and his people dwell in the cities thereof? <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it will become a desolate heap, and her daughters will be burned with fire: then will Israel possess them that did possess him, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam will go into captivity, his priests and his princes together. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Wherefore gloriest you in the valleys, your flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, <span class="add">saying</span>, Who will come to me? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will bring a fear upon you, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all that are round about you; and you will be driven out every man right forth, and there will be none to gather together the fugitives. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Of Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Flee you, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy until they had enough? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he will not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors; and he is not. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in me. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup will assuredly drink; and art you he that will altogether go unpunished? you shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah will become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof will be perpetual wastes.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>I have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, <span class="add">saying</span>, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I have made you small among the nations, and despised among men. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>As for your terribleness, the pride of your heart hath deceived you, O you that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: yough you shouldest make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Edom will become an astonishment: every one that passeth by it will be astonished, and will hiss at all the plagues thereof. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, no man will dwell there, neither will any son of man sojourn therein. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Behold, he will come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear you the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they will drag them away, <span class="add">even</span> the little ones of the flock; surely he will make their habitation desolate over them. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Behold, he will come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore her young men will fall in her streets, and all the men of war will be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote.</div><div class="p" >Thus saith Jehovah: Arise you, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Their tents and their flocks will they take; they will carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they will cry to them, Terror on every side! <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Flee you, wander far off, dwell in the depths, O you inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Arise, get you up to a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith Jehovah; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And their camels will be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter to all winds them that have the corners <span class="add">of their hair</span> cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And Hazor will be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation for ever: no man will dwell there, neither will any son of man sojourn therein.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there will be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam will not come. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith Jehovah; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them: <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there king and princes, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>But it will come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith Jehovah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
