<span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they will all be consumed; in the land of Egypt will they fall; they will be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they will die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they will be an execration, <span class="add">and</span> an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, will escape or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none will return save such as will escape.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>As for the word that you hast spoken to us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken to you. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out drink-offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people that had given him that answer, saying, <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and came it not into his mind? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>so that Jehovah could not longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened to you, as it is this day.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt: <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her: establish then your vows, and perform your vows. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear you the word of Jehovah, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jehovah, that my name will no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Jehovah liveth. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And they that escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, will know whose word will stand, mine, or theirs. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And this will be the sign to you, saith Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that my words will surely stand against you for evil: <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
