If it seem good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well to you; but if it seem ill to you to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before you; whither it seemeth good and right to you to go, there go. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, <span class="add">said he</span>, to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth right to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a present, and let him go. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon; <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, <span class="add">to wit</span>, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware to them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans that will come to us: but you, gather you wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and said to him, Dost you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray you, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it: wherefore should he take your life, that all the Jews that are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish? <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing; for you speakest falsely of Ishmael.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
