Then said Jeremiah to him, Jehovah hath not called your name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them captive to Babylon, and will slay them with the sword. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they will make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And you, Pashhur, and all that dwell in your house will go into captivity; and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and there shall you be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you hast prophesied falsely.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>O Jehovah, you hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded; you are stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocketh me. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Jehovah is made a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot <span class="add">contain</span>. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, <span class="add">say</span> all my familiar friends, they that watch for my fall; peradventure he will be persuaded, and we will prevail against him, and we will take our revenge on him. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But Jehovah is with me as a mighty one <span class="add">and</span> a terrible: therefore my persecutors will stumble, and they will not prevail; they will be utterly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which will never be forgotten. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But, O Jehovah of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Sing to Jehovah, praise you Jehovah; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man-child is born to you; making him very glad. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime; <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
