And all the people were gathered to Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And when the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of Jehovah; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Jehovah’s <span class="add">house</span>. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death; for he hath prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then spoke Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But as for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as is good and right in your eyes. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Only know you for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth Jehovah hath sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then said the princes and all the people to the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy of death; for he hath spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear Jehovah, and entreat the favor of Jehovah, and Jehovah repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them?
