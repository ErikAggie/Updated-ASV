And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin), <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing; hide nothing from me. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, wilt you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, you will not hearken to me. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>So Zedekiah the king sware secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither I will give to you into the hand of these men that seek your life.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and your house. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. Obey, I beseech you, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak to you: so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah hath showed me: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say, Your familiar friends have set you on, and have prevailed over you: <span class="add">now that</span> your feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and say to you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you: <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>then you shall say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.</div><div class="p" >And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
