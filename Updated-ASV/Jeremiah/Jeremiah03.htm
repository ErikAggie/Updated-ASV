But you hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Lift up thine eyes to the bare heights, and see; where hast you not been lain with? By the ways hast you sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you hast polluted the land with your whoredoms and with your wickedness. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; yet you hadst a harlot’s forehead, you refusedst to be ashamed. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Wilt you not from this time cry to me, My Father, you art the guide of my youth? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Will he retain <span class="add">his anger</span> for ever? will he keep it to the end?
