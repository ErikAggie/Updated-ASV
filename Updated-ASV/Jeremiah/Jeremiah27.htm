<span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For I have not sent them, saith Jehovah, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that ye may perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovah’s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city, <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>yea, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, saith Jehovah; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
