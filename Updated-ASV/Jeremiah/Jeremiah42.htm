behold, I will pray to Jehovah your God according to your words; and it will come to pass that whatsoever thing Jehovah will answer you, I will declare it to you; I will keep nothing back from you. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us, if we do not according to all the word wherewith Jehovah your God will send you to us. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>and said to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him: <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>If you will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done to you. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith Jehovah: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But if you say, We will not dwell in this land; so that you obey not the voice of Jehovah your God, <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell: <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>now therefore hear you the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>then it will come to pass, that the sword, which you fear, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof you are afraid, will follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there you will die. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>So will it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my wrath hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured forth upon you, when you will enter into Egypt; and you will be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you will see this place no more. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Jehovah hath spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Go you not into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified to you this day. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us to Jehovah our God; and according to all that Jehovah our God will say, so declare to us, and we will do it. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyoud the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he hath sent me to you. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Now therefore know certainly that you will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither you desire to go to sojourn there.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
