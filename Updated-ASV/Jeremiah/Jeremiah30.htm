<span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he will be saved out of it. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds; and strangers will no more make him their bondman; <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>but they will serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore fear you not, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob will return, and will be quiet and at ease, and none will make him afraid. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For I am with you, saith Jehovah, to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no wise leave you unpunished. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For thus saith Jehovah, Your hurt is incurable, and your wound grievous. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>There is none to plead your cause, that you mayest be bound up: you have no healing medicines. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>All your lovers have forgotten you; they seek you not: for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Why criest you for your hurt? your pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore all they that devour you will be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity; and they that despoil you will be a spoil, and all that prey upon you will I give for a prey. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, saith Jehovah; because they have called you an outcast, <span class="add">saying</span>, It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city will be builded upon its own hill, and the palace will be inhabited after its own manner. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And out of them will proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they will not be few; I will also glorify them, and they will not be small. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Their children also will be as aforetime, and their congregation will be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And their prince will be of themselves, and their ruler will proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he will approach to me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach to me? saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And you will be my people, and I will be your God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, <span class="add">even his</span> wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it will burst upon the head of the wicked. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>The fierce anger of Jehovah will not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you will understand it.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
