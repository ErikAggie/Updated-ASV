Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Every man is become brutish <span class="add">and is</span> without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel <span class="add">it</span>.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is <span class="add">my</span> grief, and I must bear it. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name; for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
