But he hearkened not to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee, that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
