<span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then shall you say to them, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith Jehovah: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Hear you, and give ear; be not proud; for Jehovah hath spoken. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But if you will not hear it, my soul will weep in secret for <span class="add">your </span> pride; and mine eye will weep sore, and run down with tears, because Jehovah’s flock is taken captive.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Say you to the king and to the queen-mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headtires are come down, even the crown of your glory. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>What wilt you say, when he will set over you as head those whom you hast yourself taught to be friends to you? will not sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And if you say in your heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered, and your heels suffer violence. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me, saith Jehovah; because you hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore will I also uncover your skirts upon your face, and your shame will appear. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your whoredom, on the hills in the field.
