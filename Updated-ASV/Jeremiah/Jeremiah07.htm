Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And now, because you have done all these works, saith Jehovah, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you heard not; and I called you, but you answered not: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name, wherein you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear you. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Seest you not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Do they provoke me to anger? saith Jehovah; <span class="add">do they</span> not <span class="add">provoke</span> themselves, to the confusion of their own faces? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, mine anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat you flesh. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices: <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>but this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken to my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk you in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in <span class="add">their own</span> counsels <span class="add">and</span> in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them: <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>yet they hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And you shall speak all these words to them; but they will not hearken to you: you shall also call to them; but they will not answer you. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And you shall say to them, This is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, nor received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Cut off your hair, <span class="add">O Jerusalem</span>, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for Jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, saith Jehovah: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place <span class="add">to bury</span>. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
