Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, <span class="add">according to</span> the law and custom, and that which was open: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle’s <span class="add">son</span>, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And I charged Baruch before them, saying, <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards will yet again be bought in this land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Jehovah, saying, <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, you hast made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for you, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>who showest lovingkindness to thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts is his name; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among <span class="add">other</span> men; and madest you a name, as at this day; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and didst bring forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>and gavest them this land, which you didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commandedst them to do: therefore you hast caused all this evil to come upon them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Behold, the mounds, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what you hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, you seest it. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And you hast said to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy you the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah, saying, <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face, <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And they have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through <span class="add">the fire</span> to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And now therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And they will be my people, and I will be their God: <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And fields will be bought in this land, whereof you say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Men will buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith Jehovah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
