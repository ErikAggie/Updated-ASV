My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right; <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>for both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>They say continually unto them that despise me, Jehovah hath said, Ye shall have peace; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah, that he should perceive and hear his word? who hath marked my word, and heard it? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, <span class="add">even his</span> wrath, is gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>The anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I spake not unto them, yet they prophesied. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah.
