Did not your father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? then it was well with him. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But thine eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they will not lament for him, <span class="add">saying</span>, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They will not lament for him, <span class="add">saying</span> Ah lord! or, Ah his glory! <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>He will be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all your lovers are destroyed. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>I spake to you in your prosperity; but you saidst, I will not hear. This hath been your manner from your youth, that you obeyedst not my voice. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The wind will feed all your shepherds, and your lovers will go into captivity: surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest your nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shall you be when pangs come upon you, the pain as of a woman in travail!</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>As I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck you there; <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>and I will give you into the hand of them that seek your life, and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And I will cast you out, and your mother that bare you, into another country, where you were not born; and there will you die. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return, there will they not return. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein none delighteth? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah, Write you this man childless, a man that will not prosper in his days; for no more will a man of his seed prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling in Judah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
