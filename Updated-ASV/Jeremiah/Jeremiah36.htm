So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came to them. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst you write all these words at his mouth? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and <span class="add">there was a fire in</span> the brazier burning before him. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that <span class="add">the king</span> cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah hid them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Take you again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from thence man and beast? <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides to them many like words.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
