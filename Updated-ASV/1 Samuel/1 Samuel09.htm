And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the asses. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the asses, and be anxious for us. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go there; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what will we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, <span class="add">he is</span> before you: make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place: <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>as soon as you are come into the city, you will straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; <span class="add">and</span> afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time you will find him. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And they went up to the city; <span class="add">and</span> as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Now Jehovah had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>To-morrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come to me. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spake to you! this same will have authority over my people. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer’s house is. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you will eat with me to-day: and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And as for your asses that were lost three days ago, set not your mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father’s house? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest you to me after this manner?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it by you. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And <span class="add">Samuel</span> said, Behold, that which hath been reserved! set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time hath it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the housetop. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand you still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
