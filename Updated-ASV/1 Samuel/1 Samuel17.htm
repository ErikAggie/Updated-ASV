am not I a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then will you be our servants, and serve us. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken <span class="add">in years</span> among men. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Beth-lehem. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry <span class="add">them</span> quickly to the camp to your brethren; <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and look how your brethren fare, and take their pledge. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brethren. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it will be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What will be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So will it be done to the man that killeth him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake to the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art you come down? and with whom hast you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you are come down that you mightest see the battle. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause? <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And he turned away from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And Saul said to David, You art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And David said to Saul, Your servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock, <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Your servant smote both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine will be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And David said, Jehovah that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and Jehovah will be with you. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And the Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man that bare the shield went before him. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Then said David to the Philistine, You comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to you in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you hast defied. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>This day will Jehovah deliver you into my hand; and I will smite you, and take your head from off you; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah’s, and he will give you into our hand. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp. <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell. <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>And the king said, Inquire you whose son the stripling is. <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>And Saul said to him, Whose son art you, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
