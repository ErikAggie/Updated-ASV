Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it will seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privately. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said to his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Jehovah’s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah’s anointed. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearkenest you to men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh your hurt? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Jehovah had delivered you to-day into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you; but <span class="add">mine eye</span> spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Jehovah’s anointed. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and killed you not, know you and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, yough you huntest after my life to take it. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Jehovah judge between me and you, and Jehovah avenge me of you; but my hand will not be upon you. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes wickedness; but my hand will not be upon you. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Jehovah therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he said to David, You art more righteous than I; for you hast rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to you evil. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And you hast declared this day how that you hast dealt well with me, forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into your hand, you killedst me not. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward you good for that which you hast done to me this day. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Swear now therefore to me by Jehovah, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father’s house. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And David sware to Saul.
