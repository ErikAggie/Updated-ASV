And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and thus will you say to him that liveth <span class="add">in prosperity</span>, Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you hast. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And now I have heard that you hast shearers: your shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there anything missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Ask your young men, and they will tell you: wherefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray you, whatsoever cometh to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I know not whence they are? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields: <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow, that one cannot speak to him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And she said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him: and he hath returned me evil for good. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one man-child.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let your handmaid, I pray you, speak in your ears, and hear you the words of your handmaid. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Let not my lord, I pray you, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I your handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom you didst send. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as your soul liveth, seeing Jehovah hath withholden you from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And now this present which your servant hath brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men that follow my lord. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Forgive, I pray you, the trespass of your handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of Jehovah; and evil will not be found in you all your days. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And though men be risen up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord will be bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah your God; and the souls of your enemies, them will he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And it will come to pass, when Jehovah will have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning you, and will have appointed you prince over Israel, <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>that this will be no grief to you, nor offence of heart to my lord, either that you hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself. And when Jehovah will have dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me: <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging myself with mine own hand. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting you, except you hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, Go up in peace to your house; see, I have hearkened to your voice, and have accepted your person.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass about ten days after, that Jehovah smote Nabal, so that he died.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal hath Jehovah returned upon his own head. And David sent and spake concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake to her, saying, David hath sent us to you, to take you to him to wife. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
