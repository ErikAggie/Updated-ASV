And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Samuel did that which Jehovah spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest you peaceably? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah’s anointed is before him. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But Jehovah said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for <span class="add">Jehovah seeth </span> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down until he come hither. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Saul’s servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth you. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Let our lord now command your servants, that are before you, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it will come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon you, that he will play with his hand, and you shall be well. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Jehovah is with him. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Wherefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, who is with the sheep. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jesse took an ass <span class="add">laden</span> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray you, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the <span class="add">evil</span> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
