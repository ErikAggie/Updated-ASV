And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Jehovah, were there. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And <span class="add">as</span> he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weepest you? and why eatest you not? and why is your heart grieved? am not I better to you than ten sons?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah, and wept sore. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if you wilt indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but wilt give to your handmaid a man-child, then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and there will no razor come upon his head.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Eli said to her, How long wilt you be drunken? put away your wine from you. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Count not your handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant your petition that you hast asked of him. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And she said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat; and her countenance was no more <span class="add">sad</span>.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>and it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, <span class="add">saying</span>, Because I have asked him of Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, <span class="add">I will not go up</span> until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seemeth you good; tarry until you have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And she said, Oh, my lord, as your soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here, praying to Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him: <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain. This modification is Copyright 2019 by Erik Peterson.
