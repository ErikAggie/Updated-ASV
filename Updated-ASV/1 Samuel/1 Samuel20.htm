And they went out both of them into the field.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan said to David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, <span class="add">be witness</span>: when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, <span class="add">or</span> the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I disclose it not to you, and send you away, that you mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with you, as he hath been with my father. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And you shall not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, <span class="add">saying</span>, And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David’s enemies.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then Jonathan said to him, To-morrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And when you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you didst hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And, behold, I will send the lad, <span class="add">saying</span>, Go, find the arrows. If I say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you; take them, and come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way; for Jehovah hath sent you away. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And as touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between you and me for ever.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side: but David’s place was empty. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless Saul spoke not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, <span class="add">which was </span> the second <span class="add">day</span>, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>and he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me <span class="add">to be there</span>: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come to the king’s table.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done? <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you? <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of <span class="add">a place </span> toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
