And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or <span class="add">rather</span> these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away <span class="add">to me</span> to this day? <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for wherewith should this <span class="add">fellow</span> reconcile himself to his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying,</div><div class="q" >Saul hath slain his thousands,</div><div class="q" >And David his ten thousands?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Jehovah liveth, you hast been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day: nevertheless the lords favor you not. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that you displease not the lords of the Philistines. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what hast you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king? <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He will not go up with us to the battle. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord that are come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines.
