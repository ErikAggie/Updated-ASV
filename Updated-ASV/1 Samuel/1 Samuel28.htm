And Achish said to David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go out with me in the host, you and your men. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And David said to Achish, Therefore you shall know what your servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make you keeper of my head for ever.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine to me, I pray you, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomsoever I will name to you. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the woman said to him, Behold, you knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest you a snare for my life, to cause me to die? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Saul sware to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, there will no punishment happen to you for this thing. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then said the woman, Whom will I bring up to you? And he said, Bring me up Samuel. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saul. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what seest you? And the woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he said to her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you mayest make known to me what I will do. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost you ask of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from you, and is become your adversary? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah hath done to you, as he spoke by me: and Jehovah hath rent the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Because you obeyedst not the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath Jehovah done this thing to you this day. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Moreover Jehovah will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shall you and your sons be with me: Jehovah will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid hath hearkened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to your words which you spakest to me. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, I pray you, hearken you also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you mayest have strength, when you goest on your way. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof: <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
