And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see), <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down <span class="add">to sleep</span>, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was; <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>that Jehovah called Samuel: and he said, Here am I. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed to him. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it will be, if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, Jehovah; for your servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for your servant heareth. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that hears it will tingle. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eliâ€™s house will not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he said, What is the thing that <span class="add">Jehovah</span> hath spoken to you? I pray you, hide it not from me: God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
