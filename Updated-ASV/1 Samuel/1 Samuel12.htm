And they said, He is witness.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to the people, It is Jehovah that appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But they forgat Jehovah their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And they cried to Jehovah, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you dwelt in safety. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, Nay, but a king will reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Now therefore behold the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for: and, behold, Jehovah hath set a king over you. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>If you will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and both you and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of Jehovah your God, <span class="add">well</span>: <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>but if you will not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as it was against your fathers. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Jehovah will do before your eyes. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call to Jehovah, that he may send thunder and rain; and you will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of Jehovah, in asking you a king. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>So Samuel called to Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to Jehovah your God, that we die not; for we have added to all our sins <span class="add">this </span> evil, to ask us a king. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: you have indeed done all this evil; yout turn not aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and turn you not aside; for <span class="add">then would you go</span> after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people to himself. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Only fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath done for you. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But if you will still do wickedly, you will be consumed, both you and your king.</div><div class=copyright>This text is based on the American Standard Version, which is in the public domain.
