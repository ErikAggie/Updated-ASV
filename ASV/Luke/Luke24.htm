And they stood still, looking sad. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days? <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking <span class="add">it</span> he gave to them. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures? <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And they rehearsed the things <span class="add">that happened</span> in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace <span class="add">be</span> unto you. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart? <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat? <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And he took it, and ate before them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures; <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day; <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>Ye are witnesses of these things. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And he led them out until <span class="add">they were</span> over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
