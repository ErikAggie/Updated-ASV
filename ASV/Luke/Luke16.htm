I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <span class="add">riches</span>? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The law and the prophets <span class="add">were</span> until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day: <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and desiring to be fed with the <span class="add">crumbs</span> that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house; <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
