God forbid. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me: and that <span class="add">life</span> which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, <span class="add">the faith</span> which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nought.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
