What, cannot there be <span class="add">found</span> among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren, <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that <span class="add">your </span> brethren. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up us through his power. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Flee fornication.
