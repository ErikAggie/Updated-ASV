Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and <span class="add">that</span> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness: <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Wherefore let no one glory in men.
