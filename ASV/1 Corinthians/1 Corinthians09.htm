Is it for the oxen that God careth, <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, <span class="add">to thresh</span> in hope of partaking. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>If others partake of <span class="add">this</span> right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat <span class="add">of </span> the things of the temple, <span class="add">and</span> they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar? <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for <span class="add">it were</span> good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For though I was free from all <span class="add">men,</span> I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And I do all things for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they <span class="add">do it</span> to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
