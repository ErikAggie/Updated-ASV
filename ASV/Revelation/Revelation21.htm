And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But for the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part <span class="add">shall be</span> in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>having the glory of God: her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which are <span class="add">the names</span> of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, <span class="add">according to</span> the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the building of the wall thereof was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof <span class="add">is </span> the Lamb. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall be no night there): <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie: but only they that are written in the Lambâ€™s book of life.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
