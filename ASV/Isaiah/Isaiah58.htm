Behold, in the day of your fast ye find <span class="add">your own</span> pleasure, and exact all your labors. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall be thy rearward. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am.</div><div class="p" >If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday; <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>and Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, <span class="add">and</span> the holy of Jehovah honorable; and shalt honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking <span class="add">thine own</span> words: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
