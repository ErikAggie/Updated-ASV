the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; <span class="add">but</span> wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
