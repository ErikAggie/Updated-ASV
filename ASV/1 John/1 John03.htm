For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And every one that hath this hope <span class="add">set</span> on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">My</span> little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous: <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class="add">My</span> little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him: <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God; <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
