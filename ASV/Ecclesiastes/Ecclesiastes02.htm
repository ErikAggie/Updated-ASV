Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool! <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun? <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For all his days are <span class="add">but</span> sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>There is nothing better for a man <span class="add">than</span> that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For to the man that pleaseth him <span class="add">God</span> giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
