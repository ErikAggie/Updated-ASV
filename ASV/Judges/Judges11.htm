And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>So now Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them? <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And now art thou anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Jehovah’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Jehovah delivered them into his hand. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house; and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto Jehovah, and I cannot go back. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And she said unto him, My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto Jehovah; do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth, forasmuch as Jehovah hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even on the children of Ammon. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew not man. And it was a custom in Israel, <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
