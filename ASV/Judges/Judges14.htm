And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But his father and his mother knew not that it was of Jehovah; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid; and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Samson said unto them, Let me now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can declare it unto me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment; <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>but if ye cannot declare it unto me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them,</div><div class="q" >Out of the eater came forth food,</div><div class="q" >And out of the strong came forth sweetness.</div><div class="p" >And they could not in three days declare the riddle.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to impoverish us? is it not <span class="add">so</span>? <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me.
