And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body: <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and it came out behind. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened <span class="add">them</span>; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
