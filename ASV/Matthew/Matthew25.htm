Come ye forth to meet him. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For <span class="add">it is</span> as <span class="add">when</span> a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>In like manner he also that <span class="add">received</span> the two gained other two. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lordâ€™s money. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And he also that <span class="add">received</span> the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter; <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory: <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats; <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink? <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, <span class="add">even</span> these least, ye did it unto me. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels: <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
