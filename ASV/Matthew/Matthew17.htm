Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, and saying, <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and suffereth grievously; for oft-times he falleth into the fire, and oft-times into the water. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he saith unto them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Many authorities, some ancient, insert v. 21.
