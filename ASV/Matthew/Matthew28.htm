Come, see the place where the Lord lay. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers, <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And if this come to the governorâ€™s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, <span class="add">and continueth</span> until this day.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And when they saw him, they worshipped <span class="add">him</span>; but some doubted. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
