And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand.
