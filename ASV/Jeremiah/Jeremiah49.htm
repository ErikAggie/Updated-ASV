Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth Malcam possess Gad, and his people dwell in the cities thereof? <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess them that did possess him, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, <span class="add">saying</span>, Who shall come unto me? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Of Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors; and he is not. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>I have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, <span class="add">saying</span>, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I have made thee small among the nations, and despised among men. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>As for thy terribleness, the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Edom shall become an astonishment: every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, <span class="add">even</span> the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Of Damascus.
