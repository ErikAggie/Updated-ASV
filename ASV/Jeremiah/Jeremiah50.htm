publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Jehovah their God. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces thitherward, <span class="add">saying</span>, Come ye, and join yourselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that prey upon her shall be satisfied, saith Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder my heritage, because ye are wanton as a heifer that treadeth out <span class="add">the grain</span>, and neigh as strong horses; <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Because of the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Shout against her round about: she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Jehovah hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work <span class="add">to do </span> in the land of the Chaldeans. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Come against her from the utmost border; open her store-houses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath been proud against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all that took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>The king of Babylon hath heard the tidings of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, <span class="add">and</span> pangs as of a woman in travail. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Behold, <span class="add">the enemy</span> shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that can stand before me? <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, <span class="add">even</span> the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations.</div></body></html>
