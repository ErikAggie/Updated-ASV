Shall one turn away, and not return? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turneth to his course, as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the law of Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes hath wrought falsely. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The wise men are put to shame, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of Jehovah; and what manner of wisdom is in them? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall possess them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness; from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>I will utterly consume them, saith Jehovah: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf shall fade; and <span class="add">the things that</span> I have given them shall pass away from them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for Jehovah our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>We looked for peace, but no good came; <span class="add">and</span> for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay! <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those that dwell therein. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! my heart is faint within me. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: is not Jehovah in Zion? is not her King in her?
