Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, <span class="add">according to</span> the law and custom, and that which was open: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle’s <span class="add">son</span>, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And I charged Baruch before them, saying, <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto Jehovah, saying, <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for thee, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>who showest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts is his name; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, both in Israel and among <span class="add">other</span> men; and madest thee a name, as at this day; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and didst bring forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>and gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Behold, the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And thou hast said unto me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying, <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?
