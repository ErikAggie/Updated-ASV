but ye have not hearkened. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear), <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith Jehovah; that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith Jehovah, and <span class="add">I will send</span> unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment;
