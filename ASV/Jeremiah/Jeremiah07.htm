Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And now, because ye have done all these works, saith Jehovah, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>therefore will I do unto the house which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
