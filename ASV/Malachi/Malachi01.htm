Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacobâ€™s brother? saith Jehovah: yet I loved Jacob; <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and <span class="add">gave </span> his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle <span class="add">fire on</span> mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name <span class="add">shall be</span> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense <span class="add">shall be</span> offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name <span class="add">shall be</span> great among the Gentiles, saith Jehovah of hosts. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles.</div></body></html>
