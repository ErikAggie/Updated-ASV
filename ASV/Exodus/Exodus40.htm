and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments;

as Jehovah commanded Moses. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as Jehovah commanded Moses. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And he set the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as Jehovah commanded Moses. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat; <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as Jehovah commanded Moses. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys: <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</div></body></html>
