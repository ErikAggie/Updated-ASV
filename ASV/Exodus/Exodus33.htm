And it came to pass, that every one that sought Jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and <span class="add">Jehovah </span> spake with Moses. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.
