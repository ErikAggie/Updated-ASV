and hast multiplied thy whoredom, to provoke me to anger. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary <span class="add">food</span>, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of thy lewd way. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic, unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an impudent harlot; <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>in that thou buildest thy vaulted place at the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street, and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>A wife that committeth adultery! that taketh strangers instead of her husband! <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>They give gifts to all harlots; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and bribest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And thou art different from <span class="add">other</span> women in thy whoredoms, in that none followeth thee to play the harlot; and whereas thou givest hire, and no hire is given unto thee, therefore thou art different.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah: <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers; and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy children, that thou didst give unto them; <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee on every side, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy vaulted place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels; and they shall leave thee naked and bare. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>So will I cause my wrath toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord Jehovah: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness with all thine abominations.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use <span class="add">this</span> proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Thou art the daughter of thy mother, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Yet hast thou not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as <span class="add">if that were</span> a very little <span class="add">thing</span>, thou wast more corrupt than they in all thy ways. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw <span class="add">good</span>. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>Thou also, bear thou thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;

and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate. <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride, <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite unto thee round about. <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. <span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder <span class="add">sisters</span> and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. <span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah; <span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah.</div></body></html>
