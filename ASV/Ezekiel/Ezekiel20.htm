As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers; <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and sware unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I sware unto them, saying, I am Jehovah your God; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>in that day I sware unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And I gave them my statutes, and showed them mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth them. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Moreover also I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless mine eye spared them, and I destroyed them not, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>I am Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Moreover I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>because they had not executed mine ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through <span class="add">the fire</span> all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>For when I had brought them into the land, which I sware to give unto them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink-offerings. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Then I said unto them, What meaneth the high place whereunto ye go?
