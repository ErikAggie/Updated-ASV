<span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <span class="add">even</span> in him doth this man stand here before you whole. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye: <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>who by the Holy Spirit, <span class="add">by</span> the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say,</div><div class="q" >Why did the Gentiles rage,</div><div class="q" >And the peoples imagine vain things?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>The kings of the earth set themselves in array,</div><div class="q" >And the rulers were gathered together,</div><div class="q" >Against the Lord, and against his Anointed:</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together, <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness, <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one <span class="add">of them</span> said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>and laid them at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race, <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
