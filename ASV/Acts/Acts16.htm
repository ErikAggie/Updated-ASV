And she constrained us.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.
