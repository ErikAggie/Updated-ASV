and they informed the governor against Paul. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying,</div><div class="p" >Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by thy providence evils are corrected for this nation, <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Some ancient authorities insert and we would have judged him according to our law.</span></a> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Some ancient authorities insert But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</span></a> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Some ancient authorities insert commanding his accusers to come before thee.</span></a> from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered,</div><div class="p" >Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defence: <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem: <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings: <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but <span class="add">there were</span> certain Jews from Asia— <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council, <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
