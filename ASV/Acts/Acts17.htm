And some said, What would this babbler say? others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached Jesus and the resurrection. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.) <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said,</div><div class="p" >Ye men of Athens, in all things I perceive that ye are very religious. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>neither is he served by men’s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined <span class="add">their</span> appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us: <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said,</div><div class="p" >For we are also his offspring. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent: <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Thus Paul went out from among them. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
