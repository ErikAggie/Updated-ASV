and I had made ready for the building. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Howbeit Jehovah, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel; <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And of all my sons (for Jehovah hath given me many sons), he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at this day. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God;
