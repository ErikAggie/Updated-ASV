Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called? <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well: <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one <span class="add">point</span>, he is become guilty of all. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For judgment <span class="add">is</span> without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit? <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from <span class="add">thy</span> works, and I by my works will show thee <span class="add">my</span> faith. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar? <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
