behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession; <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>For thou shalt see the land
