<span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand;

and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;
