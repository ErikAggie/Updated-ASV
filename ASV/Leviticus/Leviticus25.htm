<span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto Jehovah: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourn with thee. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years;

in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather <span class="add">the grapes </span> in it of the undressed vines. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For it is a jubilee;
