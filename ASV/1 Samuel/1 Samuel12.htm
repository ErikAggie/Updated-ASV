I will call unto Jehovah, that he may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah, in asking you a king. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>So Samuel called unto Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto Jehovah thy God, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins <span class="add">this </span> evil, to ask us a king. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>and turn ye not aside; for <span class="add">then would ye go</span> after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people unto himself. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Only fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath done for you. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
