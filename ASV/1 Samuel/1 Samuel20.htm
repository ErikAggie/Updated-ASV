And they went out both of them into the field.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan said unto David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, <span class="add">be witness</span>: when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, <span class="add">or</span> the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, <span class="add">saying</span>, And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David’s enemies.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then Jonathan said unto him, To-morrow is the new moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And, behold, I will send the lad, <span class="add">saying</span>, Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for Jehovah hath sent thee away. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me for ever.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side: but David’s place was empty. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, <span class="add">which was </span> the second <span class="add">day</span>, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem: <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me <span class="add">to be there</span>: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king’s table.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother’s nakedness? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done? <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee? <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of <span class="add">a place </span> toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
