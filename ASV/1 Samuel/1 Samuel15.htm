So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of Jehovah unto Samuel, saying, <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And Samuel was wroth; and he cried unto Jehovah all night. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah: I have performed the commandment of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel; <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>and Jehovah sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah? <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God in Gilgal. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah hath rejected thee from being king over Israel. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And as Samuel turned about to go away, <span class="add">Saul</span> laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said unto him, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
