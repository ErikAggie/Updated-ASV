And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands <span class="add">lay</span> cut off upon the threshold; only <span class="add">the stump of</span> Dagon was left to him. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagonâ€™s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel <span class="add">thither</span>. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors brake out upon them. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
