Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except <span class="add">it be</span> that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him.

In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, <span class="add">are</span> for your edifying. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means <span class="add">there should be</span> strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
