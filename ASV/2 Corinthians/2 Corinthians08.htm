<span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, <span class="add">they gave</span> of their own accord, <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints: <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>and <span class="add">this</span>, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But as ye abound in everything, <span class="add">in</span> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <span class="add">in</span> all earnestness, and <span class="add">in</span> your love to us, <span class="add">see</span> that ye abound in this grace also. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And herein I give <span class="add">my</span> judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But now complete the doing also; that as <span class="add">there was</span> the readiness to will, so <span class="add">there may be</span> the completion also out of your ability. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>For if the readiness is there, <span class="add">it is</span> acceptable according as <span class="add">a man</span> hath, not according as <span class="add">he</span> hath not. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For <span class="add">I say</span> not <span class="add">this</span> that others may be eased <span class="add">and</span> ye distressed; <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>but by equality: your abundance <span class="add">being a supply</span> at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become <span class="add">a supply </span> for your want; that there may be equality: <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>as it is written, He that <span class="add">gathered</span> much had nothing over; and he that <span class="add">gathered</span> little had no lack.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel <span class="add">is spread</span> through all the churches; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in <span class="add">the matter of</span> this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and <span class="add">to show</span> our readiness: <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>avoiding this, that any man should blame us in <span class="add">the matter of </span> this bounty which is ministered by us: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which <span class="add">he hath</span> in you. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Whether <span class="add">any inquire</span> about Titus, <span class="add">he is</span> my partner and <span class="add">my</span> fellow-worker to you-ward; or our brethren, <span class="add">they are </span> the messengers of the churches, <span class="add">they are</span> the glory of Christ. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
