class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>They soon forgat his works;</div><div class="q" >They waited not for his counsel,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,</div><div class="q" >And tempted God in the desert.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he gave them their request,</div><div class="q"

><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And a fire was kindled in their company;</div><div class="q" >The flame burned up the wicked.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>They made a calf in Horeb,</div><div class="q" >And worshipped a molten image.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Thus they changed their glory</div><div class="q" >For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>They forgat God their Saviour,</div><div class="q" >Who had done great things in Egypt,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Wondrous works in the land of Ham,</div><div class="q" ><span class="add">And</span> terrible things by the Red Sea.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore he said that he would destroy them,</div><div class="q" >Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the

pleasant land,</div><div class="q" >They believed not his word,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But murmured in their tents,</div><div class="q" >And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore he sware unto them,</div><div class="q" >That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,</div><div class="q" >And scatter them in the lands.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor,</div><div class="q" >And ate the sacrifices of the dead.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings;</div><div class="q" >And the plague brake in upon them.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment;</div><div class="q" >And so the plague was stayed.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness,</div><div class="q" >Unto all generations for evermore.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,</div><div class="q" >So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>Because they were rebellious against his spirit,</div><div class="q" >And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>They did not destroy the peoples,</div><div class="q" >As Jehovah commanded them,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>But mingled themselves with the nations,</div><div class="q" >And learned their works,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And served their idols,</div><div class="q" >Which became a snare unto them.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And shed innocent blood,</div><div class="q" >Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,</div><div class="q" >Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;</div><div class="q" >And the land was polluted with blood.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Thus were they defiled with their works,</div><div class="q" >And played the harlot in their doings.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people,</div><div class="q" >And he abhorred his inheritance.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And he gave them into the hand of the nations;</div><div class="q" >And they that hated them ruled over them.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Their enemies also oppressed them,</div><div class="q" >And they were brought into subjection under their hand.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Many times did he deliver them;</div><div class="q" >But they were rebellious in their counsel,</div><div class="q" >And were brought low in their iniquity.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless he regarded their distress,</div><div class="q" >When he heard their cry:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>And he remembered for them his covenant,</div><div class="q" >And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>He made them also to be pitied</div><div class="q" >Of all those that carried them captive.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Save us, O Jehovah our God,</div><div class="q" >And gather us from among the nations,</div><div class="q" >To give thanks unto thy holy name,</div><div class="q" >And to triumph in thy praise.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>Blessed be Jehovah, the God of
