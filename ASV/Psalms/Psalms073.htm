class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Surely God is good to Israel,</div><div class="q" ><span class="add">Even</span> to such as are pure in heart.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>But as for me, my feet were almost gone;</div><div class="q" >My steps had well nigh slipped.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For I was envious at the arrogant,</div><div class="q" >When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For there are no pangs in their death;</div><div class="q" >But their strength is firm.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>They are not in trouble as <span class="add">other</span> men;</div><div class="q" >Neither are they plagued like <span class="add">other</span> men.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck;</div><div class="q" >Violence covereth them as a garment.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Their eyes stand out with fatness:</div><div class="q" >They have more than heart could wish.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression:</div><div class="q" >They speak loftily.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>They have set their mouth in the heavens,</div><div class="q" >And their tongue walketh through the earth.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore his people return hither:</div><div class="q" >And waters of a full <span class="add">cup</span> are drained by them.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And they say, How doth God know?</div><div class="q" >And is there knowledge in the Most High?</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Behold, these are the wicked;</div><div class="q" >And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart,</div><div class="q" >And washed my hands in innocency;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For all the day long have I been plagued,</div><div class="q" >And chastened every morning.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>If I had said, I will speak thus;</div><div class="q" >Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>When I thought how I might know this,</div><div class="q" >It was too painful for me;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Until I went into the sanctuary of God,</div><div class="q" >And considered their latter end.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Surely thou settest them in slippery places:</div><div class="q" >Thou castest them down to destruction.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>How are they become a desolation in a moment!</div><div class="q" >They are utterly consumed with terrors.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>As a dream when one awaketh,</div><div class="q" >So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>For my soul was grieved,</div><div class="q" >And I was pricked in my heart:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>So brutish was I, and ignorant;</div><div class="q" >I was <span class="add">as</span> a beast before thee.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless I am continually with thee:</div><div class="q" >Thou hast holden my right hand.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel,</div><div class="q" >And afterward receive me to glory.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Whom have I in heaven <span class="add">but thee</span>?</div><div class="q" >And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>My flesh and my heart faileth;</div><div class="q" ><span class="add">But</span> God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish:</div><div class="q" >Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, <span class="add">departing </span> from thee.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But it is good for me to draw near unto God:</div><div class="q" >I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge,</div><div class="q" >That I may tell of all thy works.</div><div
