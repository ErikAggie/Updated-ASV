the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me:</div><div class="q" >They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>They have compassed me about also with words of hatred,</div><div class="q" >And fought against me without a cause.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For my love they are my adversaries:</div><div class="q" >But I <span class="add">give myself unto</span> prayer.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And they have rewarded me evil for good,</div><div class="q" >And hatred for my love.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Set thou a wicked man over him;</div><div class="q" >And let an adversary stand at his right hand.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>When he is judged, let him come forth guilty;</div><div class="q" >And let his prayer be turned into sin.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Let his days be few;</div><div class="q" ><span class="add">And</span> let another take his office.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse"

cursing, and it came unto him;</div><div class="q" >And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment,</div><div class="q" >And it came into his inward parts like water,</div><div class="q" >And like oil into his bones.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself,</div><div class="q" >And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</div><div class="q" ><span
