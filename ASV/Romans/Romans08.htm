But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God: <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with <span class="add">him</span>, that we may be also glorified with <span class="add">him</span>.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for <span class="add">our </span> adoption, <span class="add">to wit</span>, the redemption of our body. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth? <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But if we hope for that which we see not, <span class="add">then</span> do we with patience wait for it.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for <span class="add">us</span> with groanings which cannot be uttered; <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to <span class="add">the will of </span> God. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good, <span class="add">even</span> to them that are called according to <span class="add">his</span> purpose. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained <span class="add">to be</span> conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren: <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>What then shall we say to these things?
