For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the many. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And not as through one that sinned, <span class="add">so</span> is the gift: for the judgment <span class="add">came</span> of one unto condemnation, but the free gift <span class="add">came</span> of many trespasses unto justification. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, <span class="add">even</span> Jesus Christ. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>So then as through one trespass <span class="add">the judgment came</span> unto all men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness <span class="add">the free gift came</span> unto all men to justification of life. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
