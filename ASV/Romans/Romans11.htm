God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel: <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened: <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And David saith,</div><div class="q" >Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,</div><div class="q" >And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see,</div><div class="q" >And bow thou down their back always.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation <span class="add">is come</span> unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry; <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy <span class="add">them that are</span> my flesh, and may save some of them. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For if the casting away of them <span class="add">is</span> the reconciling of the world, what <span class="add">shall</span> the receiving <span class="add">of them be</span>, but life from the dead? <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree; <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear: <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural <span class="add">branches</span>, be grafted into their own olive tree?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written,</div><div class="q" >There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer;</div><div class="q" >He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And this is my covenant unto them,</div><div class="q" >When I shall take away their sins.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out! <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things.
