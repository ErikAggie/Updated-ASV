Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>If Jehovah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But all the congregation bade stone them with stones.
