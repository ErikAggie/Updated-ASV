id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>These ten times have ye reproached me:</div><div class="q" >Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And be it indeed that I have erred,</div><div class="q" >Mine error remaineth with myself.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,</div><div class="q" >And plead against me my reproach;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Know now that God hath subverted me <span class="add">in my cause</span>,</div><div class="q" >And hath compassed me with his net.</div><div class="b" >&nbsp;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:</div><div class="q" >I cry for help, but there is no justice.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>He hath walled up my way that I cannot pass,</div><div class="q"
