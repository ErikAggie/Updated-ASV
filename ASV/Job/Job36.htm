is mighty, and despiseth not any:</div><div class="q" >He is mighty in strength of understanding.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>He preserveth not the life of the wicked,</div><div class="q" >But giveth to the afflicted <span class="add">their</span> right.</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>He withdraweth not his eyes from the
