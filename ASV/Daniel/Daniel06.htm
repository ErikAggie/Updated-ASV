The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. <span class="add">Now</span> the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den.
