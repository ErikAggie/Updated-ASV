And they came before the king. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon: <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye the trumpet, and say, <span class="add">Long</span> live king Solomon. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so <span class="add">too</span>. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>As Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, <span class="add">Long </span> live king Solomon. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar? <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king: <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule; <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king bowed himself upon the bed. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
