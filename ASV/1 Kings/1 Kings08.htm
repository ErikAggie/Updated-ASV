even these did the priests and the Levites bring up. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah, <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David thy father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying, <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart: <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart; <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded! <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day; <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof thou hast said, My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place; and when thou hearest, forgive.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come <span class="add">and</span> swear before thine altar in this house;

So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings. <span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span>So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. <span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David his servant, and to Israel his people.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
