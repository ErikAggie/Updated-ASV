And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: For he feared to say, My wife; lest, <span class="add">said he</span>, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold: and Jehovah blessed him. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household: and the Philistines envied him. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Now all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And they digged another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now Jehovah hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee: and we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee, <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>and they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
