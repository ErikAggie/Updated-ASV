And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering: <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire; but do thou rule over it. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And Cain told Abel his brother.
