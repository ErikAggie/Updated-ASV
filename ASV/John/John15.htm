As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and <span class="add">so </span> shall ye be my disciples. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Even as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be in you, and <span class="add">that</span> your joy may be made full. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Ye are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father I have made known unto you. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and <span class="add">that</span> your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>These things I command you, that ye may love one another. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before <span class="add">it hated</span> you. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>He that hateth me hateth my Father also. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But <span class="add">this cometh to pass</span>, that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, <span class="add">even</span> the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness of me: <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>and ye also bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
