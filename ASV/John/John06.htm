Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over unto them that had eaten. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>When therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain himself alone.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And when evening came, his disciples went down unto the sea; <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save one, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat, but <span class="add">that</span> his disciples went away alone <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>(howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks): <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Work not for the food which perisheth, but for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, <span class="add">even</span> God, hath sealed. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>They said therefore unto him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>They said therefore unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what workest thou? <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>They said therefore unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>For this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven? <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>No man can come to me, except the Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God.
