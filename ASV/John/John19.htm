And <span class="add">Pilate</span> saith unto them, Behold, the man! <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify <span class="add">him</span>, crucify <span class="add">him</span>! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid; <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>and he entered into the Prætorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee? <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Cæsar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Cæsar. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King! <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>They therefore cried out, Away with <span class="add">him</span>, away with <span class="add">him</span>, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cæsar. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha: <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, <span class="add">and </span> in Latin, <span class="add">and</span> in Greek. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith,</div><div class="q" >They parted my garments among them,</div><div class="q" >And upon my vesture did they cast lots.</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the <span class="add">wife </span> of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son! <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own <span class="add">home</span>.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high <span class="add">day</span>), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <span class="add">that</span> they might be taken away. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him: <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>And after these things Joseph of Arimathæa, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave <span class="add">him</span> leave. He came therefore, and took away his body. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
