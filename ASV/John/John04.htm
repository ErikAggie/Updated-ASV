Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water? <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle? <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband: <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am <span class="add">he</span>.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people, <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>Come, see a man, who told me all things that <span class="add">ever</span> I did: can this be the Christ? <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>They went out of the city, and were coming to him. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him <span class="add">aught</span> to eat? <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <span class="add">then</span> cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that <span class="add">ever </span> I did. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>And many more believed because of his word; <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>So when he came into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought <span class="add">him</span> that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived. <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span>So the father knew that <span class="add">it was</span> at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judæa into Galilee.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
