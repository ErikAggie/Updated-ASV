can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things? <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?
