but we ourselves together will build unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia;
