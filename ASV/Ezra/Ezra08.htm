and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And I sent them forth unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, <span class="add">and</span> his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel;

but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered: <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents;
