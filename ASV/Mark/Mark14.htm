And they murmured against her. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can do them good: but me ye have not always. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>She hath done what she could; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of the twelve, went away unto the chief priests, that he might deliver him unto them. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money.
