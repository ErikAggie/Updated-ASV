A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a pit for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And again he sent unto them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Have ye not read even this scripture:</div><div class="q" >The stone which the builders rejected,</div><div class="q" >The same was made the head of the corner;</div><div class="q" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>This was from the Lord,</div><div class="q" >And it is marvellous in our eyes?</div><div class="m" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spake the parable against them: and they left him, and went away.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And when they were come, they say unto him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou regardest not the person of men, but of a truth teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not? <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why make ye trial of me? bring me a denarius, that I may see it. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And they brought it.
