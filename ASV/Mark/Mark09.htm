And he said, From a child. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and <span class="add">the boy </span> became as one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, <span class="add">How is it</span> that we could not cast it out? <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning on the way? <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another on the way, who <span class="add">was</span> the greatest. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them, <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>John said unto him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followed not us. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>For he that is not against us is for us. <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, because ye are Christ’s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span> <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Vs. 44 and 46 (which are identical to v. 48) are omitted by some ancient authorities. where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. </span></a> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Vs. 44 and 46 (which are identical to v. 48) are omitted by some ancient authorities. where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. </span></a> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell; <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>For every one shall be salted with fire. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it?
