And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel: <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of <span class="add">other </span> lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of <span class="add">them that are </span> no gods. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and <span class="add">we have</span> priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work: <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also <span class="add">set they </span> in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
