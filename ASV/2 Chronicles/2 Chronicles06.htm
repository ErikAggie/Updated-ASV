neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel: <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and have chosen David to be over my people Israel. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart: <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah hath performed his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>(for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven); <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart; <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have builded! <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven;
