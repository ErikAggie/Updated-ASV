Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water; <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
