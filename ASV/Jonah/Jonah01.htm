But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Wherefore they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We beseech thee, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this manâ€™s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O Jehovah, hast done as it pleased thee. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto Jehovah, and made vows.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</div><div class=copyright>The American Standard Version is in the public domain, and you may use it freely.
