Therefore I hasted to flee unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repentest thee of the evil. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore now, O Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah said, Doest thou well to be angry? <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.</div><div class="p" ><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his evil case.
