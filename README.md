This is a project to update the readability of the American Standard version of the Bible. The intention is purely to update the language, not to make sense or other changse. This will happen publicly, and, as much as possible, will use using global rules (i.e. change "unto" to "to" in all instances).

Anyone is free to use this updated version, but please cite this project as your starting point--and if you make changes to the text outside of this project, YOU MUST SAY SO.

The original text package came from https://ebible.org/asv/. Changes to it should only happen when:
  1. There's a problem with a file preventing a conversion step from taking place.
  2. There's an error in the original text that needs to be applied here.
